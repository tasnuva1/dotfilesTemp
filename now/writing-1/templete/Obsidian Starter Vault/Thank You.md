Thank you for downloading the obsidian starter vault.

***Special thanks*** if you supported my work by paying for the vault.

# Getting Started
I've shared most of my notes on this obsidian vault where I've practiced [[Zettelkasten System]] inspired by Niklas Luhmann and [[How to Take Smart Notes]] book. In zettelkasten system you read, and write stuffs in your own words. There's a lot of rewriting, and thinking, which obviously consumes time and energy. 

The purpose of zettelkasten system is facilitating in creation. To write a new book. To write a new article. Or write a script for video. Even if you don't have that aim, following a zettelkasten system will make you prepared end goal of creation. 

After all, learning is creation. As George Couros said:

> Learning is creation, not consumption. Knowledge is not something a learner absorbs, but something a learner creates.


Using zettelkasten system as a note-taking method will make you think harder and understand how one idea links to the other. It will help you comprehend and solidify even the hardest concepts.
