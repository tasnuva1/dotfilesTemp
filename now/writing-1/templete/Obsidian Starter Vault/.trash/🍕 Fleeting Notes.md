-   Keyword Research: The Definitive Guide
    
-   Keyword research is the process of discovering words and phrases (aka “keywords”) that people use in search engines, like Google, Bing and YouTube.
    
-   Keyword research impacts every other SEO task that you perform, including finding content topics, [on-page SEO](https://backlinko.com/on-page-seo), [email outreach](https://backlinko.com/hub/content/email-outreach), and content promotion.
    

-   searching keywords help you better understand your target audience. That’s because keyword research gives you insight into what customers are searching for… and the exact words and phrases that they use.
    
-   the #1 factor that contributed to my site’s traffic growth was keyword resear
    
-   How to Find Keyword Ideas
    
-   Brainstorm a List of Topics
    
-   you’d want to ask yourself: ”What topics do people search for that are related to my business?”
    
-   These topics aren’t keywords (yet).
    
-   Wikipedia Table of Contents
    
-   Then, look for the “contents” section of the page. This section lists out the subtopics covered on that page
    
-   And some of the subtopics listed here are awesome keywords that would be tough to find any other way:
    

-   Searches Related To
    
-   Another cool way to find keywords is to check out the “Searches Related to” section at the bottom of Google’s search results.
    
-   Just like with Google Suggest, these are keyword ideas that come straight from Google. So you don’t need to guess whether or not they’re popular. Google is literally telling you: “Tons of people search for these keywords.”
    
-   Then, scroll to the bottom of THOSE results. This will give you a new list of related keywords. Rinse and repeat.
    
-   Find Keywords on Reddit
    
-   Use Google and YouTube Suggest
    
-   type each one of them into Google.
    
-   And see what terms that Google Suggests to you.
    
-   Because if Google suggests a keyword, you KNOW that lots of people are searching for it.
    
-   you don’t need to stop with Google Suggest.
    
- 
-   Find Popular Topics Using Forums
    
-   Keyword Research Tools
    
-   Can you find keywords without a tool?
    

-   Sure.
    

-   But a tool makes the entire process A LOT easier.
    
-   Keyword Surfer
    
-   The Google Keyword Planner
    
-   Ubersuggest
    
-   SEMrush
    
-   Instead of popping random keywords into a tool, SEMrush shows you the exact keywords that a site already ranks for.
    
-   So if you have a site that you’re competing against in Google, just pop it into SEMrush.
    
-   And steal all of their keywords.
    
-   Keyword Difficulty
    
-   How do you know if a keyword is too competitive to rank for?
    
-   Because if you choose a keyword that’s super competitive, you might have trouble getting past Google’s third page.
    
-   If your site is brand new.
    

-   Or if you want to focus 100% on keywords that aren’t competitive.
    

-   Then you DEFINITELY want to target [long tail keywords](https://backlinko.com/long-tail-keywords).
    
-   Most people in SEO (myself included) divide keywords into three main categories: head, body and the long tail.
    
-   There’s no “best” keyword category to focus on. All 3 have their pros and cons.
    
-   But when it comes to competition, long tails are usually the least competitive of the bunch.
    
-   Authority of Sites on Google’s First Page
    
-   If the first page is made up of uber authority sites (like Wikipedia), then you might want to cross that keyword off from your list:
    
-   But if you see a handful of smaller blogs on page 1, that’s a sign that you have a shot to hit the first page too.
    
-   Keyword Difficulty Inside of Keyword Tools
    
-   And we found that they all size up keyword difficulty based on a combination of page authority and domain authority. YET they all tend to come up with completely different keyword difficulty scores.
    
-   f your favorite keyword tool includes a keyword difficulty feature, go with that. It may not be perfect. But they do tend to give you a general idea of how competitive a keyword is to rank for.
    
-   How to Choose a Keyword
    
-   Search Volume
    
-   The more people search for a keyword, the more traffic you can get from it.
    
-   Search volumes vary A LOT between different industries.
    
-   For example, a long tail keyword in the fitness niche (like: “best ab exercises”) gets 10K-100K searches per month:
    
-   That’s why you want to figure out what a “high” and “low” search volume number is in your niche.
    
-   It’s no secret that the number of Google searchers that click on an organic search result [is way down](https://sparktoro.com/blog/google-ctr-in-2018-paid-organic-no-click-searches/).
    
-   And it’s no wonder why.
    

-   Featured Snippets make it so you don’t need to click on anything to get an answe
    
-   Search volume only gives you part of the story. To get a full estimate of how many clicks you’ll get from a first page Google ranking, you also need to estimate organic CTR.
    
-   you can look at [the SERPs](https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/serps) (Search Engine Results Pages) for your keyword
    
-   If you see a lot of stuff on the first page (like [a Featured Snippet](https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/featured-snippets) and multiple Google Ads), then you know that you’re not going to get a ton of clicks… even if you rank #1.
    
-   Ahrefs and Moz pro both estimate organic CTR.
    
-   I wouldn’t avoid a keyword just because it has a low CTR. If lots of people search for that term, it might still be worth going after.
    
-   Difficulty
    
-   If your site is new (or doesn’t have a ton of links yet), target low-competition terms at first.
    
-   Then, as your site grows in authority, you can start to target more competitive stuff.
    
-   CPC
    
-   Do people searching for this keyword actually spend money?
    
-   search volume is nice and all.
    
-   But if that keyword has zero commercial intent, then there’s no point in targeting that term.
    
-   Plus, you can sometimes get a great ROI from a keyword that doesn’t get that many searches… if the CPC is high enough.
    
-   Keyword Trends
    
-   Finally, you want to see if your keyword is growing fast… or dying slow.
    

-   And the best way to do that? [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/).
    
-   Advanced Tips and Strategies
    
-   Barnacle SEO
    
-   Sure, a top 3 ranking is great. But it’s still only one spot in the SERPs.
    

-   That’s why I created a YouTube video optimized for that keyword…
    
-   …a video that also ranks on Google’s first page.
    
-   Bottom line? If you find an amazing keyword, you want to take up as much first page real estate as you can. First, create content on that topic on your own site. Then, publish [keyword-optimized content](https://backlinko.com/on-page-seo) on authority sites, like YouTube, LinkedIn, Medium and more.
    
-   GSC Keyword Research
    
-   [The Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) is a goldmine of keyword ideas.
    
-   reate a piece of content optimized around that same keyword
    
-   These are keywords that you KNOW people are searching for. You also know that Google sees your site as a good fit in the search results.
    
-   Optimize Content around Synonyms and Related Keywords
    
-   But don’t stop there.
    
-   You can get even more search engine traffic to your page by optimizing it around synonyms and closely related terms.
    
-   Ahrefs Content Gap
    
-   Analyze Keywords Based on Searcher Inten
    
-   In other words, ask yourself:
    

-   What does someone searching for this keyword want to see?
    
-   A while back I created a post that ranks #2 for the keyword “BuzzStream”.
    
-   Even though that keyword gets around 2k searches/month, that post only brings in 194 monthly visitors.
    
-   Well, as it turns out, “BuzzStream” is a navigational keyword.
    
-   Which means that most people that search for that keyword are looking for the website… not information about BuzzStream.
    
-   But because it’s a navigational keyword, VERY few people click on anything but the first result. Which is why that post gets so little traffic.
    
-   That’s why I recommend looking at the [Search Intent](https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/search-intent) of a keyword.
    
-   If Search Intent is “Navigational”, then you may want to avoid that term… even if it has great CPC and monthly search volume numbers.
    
-   Find “Shoulder Keywords”
    
-   Most people ONLY optimize their site around keywords that are very closely related to what they sell.
    
-   And it’s a BIG mistake for two main reasons:
    

-   1. Product keywords are usually super competitive. 2. There are thousands of keywords that your potential customer searches for
    
-   when they’re not searching for that you sell.
    
-   I rank for keywords that my customers search for when they’re not looking for SEO training.
    
-   I call these keywords “Shoulder Keywords”.
    
-   These keywords aren’t directly related to what you sell. But they’re keywords that your customers search for. Which makes them worth going after.

The trick smoothies play on the stomach

-   in a [study](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/142/7/1253.long), and they found that when people who drank the blended “soup,” it kept them from feeling hungry for about an hour longer than the whole-food meal.
    
-   Ten dollars gets you half a banana, a scoop of peanut butter, a cup of almond milk, and ice, all under the pretense that smoothies are a healthy option for the human-on-the-go.
    
-   “All other things being equal, if you took a meal and blended it, you’re likely to feel fuller longer,” Spiller said.
    
-   “That’s why if you drank several glasses of water, you feel full, but only for about ten minutes,” said Spiller. “Whereas if you took the same volume of soup you'd feel full for a couple of hours.”
    
-   when the body has analyzed what’s coming out through the duodenum, it’ll start to take a view on whether what you took had nourishment or not. And if it didn't, you start to feel hungry again a lot quicker.
    
-   the food in the liquid phase emptied faster than the solid food.
    
-   “What we showed is that food separates in layers in the stomach,
    
-   Gravity is important in the layering, as is the position of your body.
    
-   You will digest differently in upright and prone positions, not to mention hanging upside down.
    
-   The rate of stomach emptying is regulated by feedback from the duodenum, which has receptors that can tell the body about nutrient value of a meal.
    
-   if you eat a mixed meal, the water exits the stomach rapidly and the stomach shrinks
    
-   f, by contrast, you had made that separation of liquid and solid impossible—by blending it into a smoothie or whatever—then that couldn't happen. The liquid that would come out would contain some calories.
    
-   if you drink a glass of milk, it’ll probably curdle in your stomach—the protein will separate out, and you'll be left with a translucent lactose-protein liquid, known as whey.
    
-   Nottingham team just finished a study comparing eating apples to eating puree and drinking apple juice
    
-   “When you eat an apple, there’s a lot of crunching,”
    
-   That's a strong stimulus for the gut to secrete fluid. A lot of the behavior of your intestine is anticipatory –– it has to work ahead of what's happening. It’s no good producing enzymes to digest stuff when the material arrives. That’s too late. You’ve got to produce it ahead of time.”
    
-   Just as you start to salivate before you even stick the burrito in your mouth––before you’re even in the presence of the burrito you’re imagining (a “mind burrito”)—so your pancreas and stomach start to secrete fluid ready to digest before the food is upon them.
    
-   “It’s where your brain is engaged to feed forward to the gut that food is coming, so get ready.”
    
-   Eating a bunch of apples took 20 or 30 minutes with a lot of chewing and salivation and swallowing. You can drink the same calories in a glass of apple juice in 30 seconds.
    
-   The former involved a lot more secretion of digestive enzymes in the small bowel.
    
-   “It may make a difference [to how you digest food], and the amount of time you spend over your meal may also make a difference. The one things about a smoothie is it’s very much quicker to eat a lot of calories than it is when you eat whole fruit. It might be good for you to sit down at a table and chew your way through that fruit. It’d probably take you half an hour, wouldn't it?”
    
-   I told him I can drink a smoothie in under a minute.
    
-   “Well,” he said, “that's part of the trouble of a high-pressure lifestyle, isn’t it?”
    
-   “Blending won’t have a significant negative impact on fiber,”
    
-   “Fiber is what’s responsible for the viscosity of a smoothie and its impact on the bacteria of the large bowel. Mashing fiber up into small pieces should only enhance its availability for the bacteria. Its prebiotic effect is definitely unimpaired––it might be enhanced, even.”

The shortness of life

-   If we see someone throwing money away, we call that person crazy. Money has value. Wasting it seems nuts. And yet we see others—and ourselves—throw away something far more valuable every day: Time.
    
    we often fail to think of the person who wastes time as crazy.
    
    It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested.
    
-   he life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it.
    
-   “The part of life we really live is small.” 
    
-   When you think about the reason most of us want to get wealthy, you will see it’s not for the money it’s for the time. We want a clean schedule. We want other people to do the things we don’t want to do. We want to spend money to buy time.
    
-   Wealth is best expressed by spending money to create time.
    
-   “the rich invest in time; the poor invest in money.”
    
-   A man who dares to waste an hour of time has not discovered the value of his life.
    
-   How many times do you catch yourself ‘wasting time online,’ spending hours on Instagram not learning anything?
    
-   Four Ways We Misunderstand Time
    
-   1. Productivity: We actually don’t want to be more productive. What we really want is more time. And yet because we don’t properly value time, we never end up with more; even when we find ways to work more efficiently, we don’t actually use it wisely. We simply layer in more work.
    
-   2. Investing in Learning: The upfront costs are real and visible and, like any investment, the future payoff is uncertain. So we tend to skim the surface, thinking this will “save us time” versus doing the real work.
    
-   surface learning is a true waste of time.
    
-   3. Relationships:
    
-   We’re often too “busy” to spend time with the ones we care about.
    
-   4. Meetings:
    
-   Lacking an agenda or decision, they become nothing more than half-a-meeting half-a-gossip session. A giant waste of time.
    
-   Time is invisible, so it’s easy to spend. It’s only near the end of our life that most of us will realize the value of time.
    
-   Make sure you’re not [too busy to pay attention to life](https://fs.blog/2016/02/too-busy/).
    

-   Wealth is created not by spending your time making money but rather by saving your time to make money.

-   If you’re someone who enjoys and/or makes an income through writing, I hope this trick helps you too.
    
-   real-time edits are distracting.
    
-   Real-time edits take away from the free-flowing thought process — the creative and imaginative side of my brain — in favor of the sequencing side of my brain. The side that wants things to be neat and orderly.
    
-   The constant mental switching leaves me with too much downtime in the process. I
    
-   really hard for me to get through an article from start to finish.
    
-   what is writing?
    
-   Ultimately, I look at it as translating thoughts from my brain into text that can be read and understood by someone else. For me, it’s a transcription and thought transfer process.
    
-   physical typing is not the most efficient way to write.
    
-   The Key to Efficiency: Talk-to-Text
    
-   I share my words and let technology transcribe them for me.
    
-   But talk-to-text isn’t perfect. It makes context errors (or I make speaking errors) and what ends up typed out may not be exactly what I had intende
    
-   I can make minor corrections without interrupting my thought proces
    
-   The elephant in the room: is physical typing essential to being a writer?
    
-   Initially, I thought physical typing might be essential to my identity as a writer.
    
-   I now consider talk-to-text to be just another step in the direction of writing efficiency.
    
-   we all know the artistic part of writing — the part that makes a piece feel cohesive, polished, well-organized — usually happens later in the editing process anyway.
    
-   A way to get more ideas translated into text that can be read and understood by others. Just as these other innovations were.

-   I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high school
    
-   what you want to do with your life.
    
-   They want to know what sort of person you are, and this question is just to get you talking.
    
-   You don't need to be in a rush to choose your life's work. What you need to do is discover what you like. You have to work on stuff you like if you want to be good at what you do.
    
-   Being a doctor is not the way it's portrayed on TV.
    
-   there are other jobs you can't learn about, because no one is doing them yet.
    
-   The world changes fast, and the rate at which it changes is itself speeding up. In such a world it's not a good idea to have fixed plans.
    
-   The computer world has a name for this: premature optimization. And it is synonymous with disaster. These speakers would do better to say simply, don't give up.
    
-   What they really mean is, don't get demoralized.
    
-   Don't think that you can't do what other people can.
    
-   In fact I suspect if you had the sixteen year old Shakespeare or Einstein in school with you, they'd seem impressive, but not totally unlike your other friends.
    
-   If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy.
    
-   t's not our fault if we can't do something as good.
    
-   'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.
    
-   There is some variation in natural ability. Most people overestimate its role, but it does exist.
    
-   If I were talking to a guy four feet tall whose ambition was to play in the NBA, I'd feel pretty stupid saying, you can do anything if you really try.
    
-   don't underestimate your abilities
    
-   think the solution is to work in the other direction. Instead of working back from a goal, work forward from promising situations. This is what most successful people actually do anyway.
    
-   you decide where you want to be in twenty years, and then ask: what should I do now to get there?
    
-   you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.
    
-   It's not so important what you work on, so long as you're not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you'll take.
    
-   Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it's probably worthwhile to join it.
    
-   they're deliberately written in an obscure way to seem as if they're saying something important.
    
-   Suspecting that the papers published by literary theorists were often just intellectual-sounding nonsense, a physicist deliberately wrote a paper full of intellectual-sounding nonsense, and submitted it to a literary theory journal, which published it.
    
-   he best protection is always to be working on hard problems.
    
-   Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to be suspense.
    
-   Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't.
    
-   It's exhilarating to overcome worries.
    
-   You don't see faces much happier than people winning gold medals. And you know why they're so happy? Relief.
    
-   Ambition
    
-   If you'd asked me in high school what the difference was between high school kids and adults, I'd have said it was that adults had to earn a living. Wrong. It's that adults take responsibility for themselves. Making a living is only a small part of it. Far more important is to take intellectual responsibility for oneself.
    
-   If I had to go through high school again, I'd treat it like a day job.
    
-   And when I wasn't working at my day job I'd start trying to do real work.
    
-   When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they nearly all say the same thing: that they wasted so much time.
    
-   I'm not saying you shouldn't hang out with your friends — that you should all become humorless little robots who do nothing but work. Hanging out with friends is like chocolate cake. You enjoy it more if you eat it occasionally than if you eat nothing but chocolate cake for every meal.
    
-   Collecting donations for a charity is an admirable thing to do, but it's not hard.
    
-   What I mean by getting something done is learning how to write well, or how to program computers, or what life was really like in preindustrial societies, or how to draw the human face from life.
    
-   Corruption
    
-   the people you have to impress to get into college are not a very discerning audience
    
-   Fouls happen. The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool. Just keep playing.
    
    Yes, as you suspect, a lot of the stuff you learn in your classes is crap.
    
    the college admissions process is largely a charade. But like many fouls, this one was unintentional. [7] So just keep playing.
    
    Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience.
    
    Don't just do what they tell you, and don't just refuse to.
    
    Instead treat school as a day job. As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet. You're done at 3 o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.
    
    Curiosity
    
    what's your real job supposed to be? Unless you're Mozart, your first task is to figure that out. What are the great things to work on? Where are the imaginative people? And most importantly, what are you interested in
    
    A better name would be curiosity.
    

-   In most adults this curiosity dries up entirely.
    
-   But in ambitious adults, instead of drying up, curiosity becomes narrow and deep.
    
-   Curiosity turns work into play.
    
-   For Einstein, relativity wasn't a book full of hard stuff he had to learn for an exam. It was a mystery he was trying to solve. So it probably felt like less work to him to invent it than it would seem to someone now to learn it in a class.
    
-   most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline.
    
-   They have little discipline. They're all terrible procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves do anything they're not interested in.
    
-   I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need about the amount you need to go running
    
-   hey know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary.
    
-   Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having fun. That's why he's so good.
    
-   If you want to do good work, what you need is a great curiosity about a promising question.
    
-   only later did he start to ask questions instead of merely answering them correctly.
    
-   find a way to make it interesting. That's what you need to do: find a question that makes the world interesting.
    
-   eople who do great things look at the same world everyone else does, but notice some odd detail that's compellingly mysterious.
    
-   Now
    
-   f it takes years to articulate great questions, what do you do now, at sixteen? Work toward finding one.
    
-   Great questions don't appear suddenly. They gradually congeal in your head.
    
-   the way to find great questions is not to search for them — not to wander about thinking, what great discovery shall I make? You can't answer that; if you could, you'd have made it.
    
-   The way to get a big idea to appear in your head is not to hunt for big ideas, but to put in a lot of time on work that interests you, and in the process keep your mind open enough that a big idea can take roost.
    
-   Put in time how and on what? Just pick a project that seems interesting: to master some chunk of material, or to make something, or to answer some question
    
-   hoose a project that will take less than a month, and make it something you have the means to finish. Do something hard enough to stretch you, but only just, especially at first
    
-   If you're deciding between two projects, choose whichever seems most fun. If one blows up in your face, start another.
    
-   Involve your friends if you want, but not too many, and only if they're not flakes.
    
-   secrecy also has its advantages.
    
-   There's something pleasing about a secret project. And you can take more risks, because no one will know if you fail.
    
-   Paths can bend a lot more than you think.
    
-   let the path grow out the project. The most important thing is to be excited about it, because it's by doing that you learn.
    
-   Don't disregard unseemly motivations. One of the most powerful is the desire to be better than other people at something.
    
-   Another powerful motivator is the desire to do, or know, things you're not supposed to.
    
-   what excited me was the idea of writing serious, intellectual stuff like the famous writers.
    
-   Now I have enough experience to realize that those famous writers actually sucked. Plenty of famous people do; in the short term, the quality of one's work is only a small component of fame
    
-   I should have been less worried about doing something that seemed cool, and just done something I liked.
    
-   Most books are bad. Nearly all textbooks are bad. [9] So don't assume a subject is to be learned from whatever book on it happens to be closest. You have to search actively for the tiny number of good books.
    
-   Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers. It could be shaped by your own curiosity.
    
-   In fact, you don't have to wait to be an adult.
    
-   You start being an adult when you decide to take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age.
    
-   you may think, I have no money, I have to live at home, I have to do what adults tell me all day long.
    
-   The only real difference between adults and high school kids is that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school kids don't. That realization hits most people around 23. But I'm letting you in on the secret early. So get to work. Maybe you can be the first generation whose greatest regret from high school isn't how much time you wasted.

-   How to Retain What You Learn
    
-   Learning is a meta-skill—arguably the most important meta-skill.
    
-   The retention framework I use involves five steps: (1) Inspired Consumption; (2) Unstructured Note-Taking; (3) Consolidation; (4) Analogize; and (5) Idea Exercise. The structure is sequential, but its practice is often dynamic & iterative.
    
-   Spaced Repetition is the most formal—and powerful—idea exercise method. It’s a method in which information is consumed at increasing intervals until it's committed to long-term memory. It leverages cognitive science—the way our brains work to convert short-term to long-term memory—to help you retain newly-consumed information.
    
-   How to Retain What You Learn
    
-   Our brains are just software. When we learn, we are updating that software.
    
-   But in the real world, though, our software is flawed and buggy—we forget important things or overwrite old data all the time.
    
-   Develop a strategy for retention that is grounded in science.
    
-   The Retention Framework
    
-   The retention framework I use involves five steps:
    
-   1.  Inspired Consumption
        
    2.  Unstructured Note-Taking
        
    3.  Consolidation
        
    4.  Analogize
        
    5.  Idea Exercise
        
    6.  Step 1: Inspired Consumption
        
    7.  I bucket consumption into two types:
        
    8.  -   Forced: Compelled, either internally or externally.
            
        -   Inspired: Driven entirely by your internal inspirations.
            
    9.  Forced consumption is the book you're told to read, despite the topic being of zero interest to you. It's the foundation of much of the traditional education system—yet another reason why so many of us are bad at learning retention!
        
    10.  Inspired consumption is when you feel genuinely pulled to consume—when you enjoy the consumption process.
        
    11.  Inspired consumption is important for retention for two key reasons.
        
    12.  1.  Inspiration is a precursor to flow. More flow state, more retention.
            
        2.  Inspiration fuels engagement. Engage with the content, retain the content.
            
        3.  Inspired consumption is the foundation of retention.
            
        4.  Step 2: Unstructured Note-Taking
            
        5.  When you start consuming, you should have a note-taking system in front of you.
            
        6.  What to take note of:
            
        7.  -   Foundation-building ideas
                
            -   Novel insights
                
            -   Things that made you go “hmmm” or “wow!”
                
            -   Connections you identified to other topics
                
            -   Questions or confusion
                
            -   Strong reactions you had to new information
                
            -   This first pass of notes is intended to be unstructured. The simple act of writing helps ideas stick.
                
            -   Step 3: Consolidation
                
            -   Zoom out and review your unstructured notes.
                
            -   Consolidation is where you re-consume content with a specific focus on building structure around your notes in these particular areas.
                
            -   If unstructured note-taking created a bunch of dots, consolidation is where you start connecting them.
                
            -   Step 4: Analogize
                
            -   you take your newly-learned information and place it within your broader mental maps. You make clear comparisons and connections between newly-learned and existing information.
                
            -   Step 5: Idea Exercise
                
            -   Think of the new idea as a muscle—if left on its own, it will atrophy. You have to exercise it—early and often.
                
            -   If you exercise the idea, it will stick and grow.
                
            -   Spaced Repetition - The History & Science
                
            -   Spaced Repetition is a scientifically-proven method for enhanced retention. It’s a method in which information is consumed at increasing intervals until it's committed to long-term memory.
                
            -   Spaced Repetition - Putting It Into Action
                
            -   Let's say you're trying to learn some facts about Apple—its history, business segments, financial performance, etc.
                
            -   If this was for a college exam, you'd probably do this the "old fashioned way”—down some espresso, cram it into your mind, and hope you remember it for the test the next day. But you're not in college anymore—you want this learning for life, not for some one-off exam. You want this to stick.
                
            -   So instead of the old way, you go with the new way—Spaced Repetition.
                
            -   You first consume the new information at 8am. Then you start “repetitions” where you recite back learnings and fill gaps:
                
            -   Repetition 1: 9am (1 hr later)
                
            -   Repetition 2: 12pm (3 hrs later)
                
            -   Repetition 3: 6pm (6 hrs later)
                
            -   Repetition 4: 6am (12 hrs later)
                
            -   and so on at increasing intervals...
                
            -   you can think of your brain as a muscle—each repetition is a "flex" of that muscle. By steadily increasing the intervals, you are pushing the muscle with steadily more challenging loads. You're forcing the retention muscle to grow

People Who Have “Too Many Interests” Are More Likely To Be Successful According To Research | by Michael Simmons | Accelerated Intelligence | Medium

-   The warning against being a generalist has persisted for [hundreds of years in dozens of languages](http://snip.ly/rrLW). “Equipped with knives all over, yet none is sharp,” warn people in China. In Estonia, it goes, “Nine trades, the tenth one — hunger.”
    
-   many of the most impactful individuals, both contemporary and historical, have been generalists: Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Richard Feynman, Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Marie Curie to name just a few.
    
-   The Era of the Modern Polymath
    
-   “The future belongs to the integrators.” — Educator Ernest Boyer
    
-   I define a modern polymath as someone who becomes competent in at least three diverse domains and integrates them into a top 1-percent skill set.
    
-   many now believe that to become world-class in a skill, they must complete 10,000 hours of deliberate practice in order to beat the competition, going as deep as possible into one field.
    
-   Modern polymaths go against the grain of this popular advice, building atypical combinations of skills and knowledge across fields and then integrating them to create breakthrough ideas and even brand new fields and industries where there is little competition.
    
-   In order to become an effective online writer, I’ve deliberately combined academic research, digital journalism, and growth hacking into one skillset.
    
-   didn’t go to college for any of these skills, but practiced them over time and received coaching on them.
    
-   Why Being A Modern Polymath Is The New Normal
    
-   “Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses — especially learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.”
    
-   — Leonardo Da Vinci
    
-   In today’s world, diverse interests are not a curse, they’re a blessing. Being a polymath instead of a specialist is an advantage, not a weakness.
    
-   People who love learning across fields can use that tendency to be more financially successful and impactful in their career.
    
-   Polymath Advantage 1: Creating an atypical combination of two or more skills that you’re merely competent can lead to a world-class skill set.
    
    -   If you want something extraordinary [in life], you have two paths:
        
    -   1. Become the best at one specific thing. 2. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.
        
    -   . It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.
        
-   Polymath Advantage 2: Most creative breakthroughs come via making atypical combinations of skills.
    
-   The top performing studies cited atypical combinations of other studies (90 percent conventional citations from their own field and 10 percent from other fields).
    
-   Polymath Advantage 3: It’s easier and faster than ever to become competent in a new skill.
    
    -   The quality of knowledge in every domain is improving.
        
    -   The technology field is smarter than it was 20 years ago, for example. So are the fields of physics and biology.
        
    -   Second, there is an abundance of free or affordable content from the world’s top experts in every medium you can think of.
        
    -   This is the golden era for people who value learning, are willing to invest in themselves, and who are disciplined enough to take action on their own.
        
    -   As Isaac Newton famously proclaimed, “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” In today’s era, we have more shoulders to stand on than ever.
        
-   Polymath Advantage 4: It’s easier than ever to pioneer a new field, industry, or skill set.
    
    -   While the explosion of knowledge is making it impossible or at least more difficult for anyone to know everything, it has also made it easier to find one big, atypical combination of fields or skills. It’s easier than ever to be a polymath.
        
    -   And finally, as the number of new skills increases, the number of possible combinations increases exponentially
        
    -   Every new chunk of knowledge can theoretically be combined with every other knowledge chunk. Every new breakthrough creates the potential for exponentially more breakthroughs.
        
    -   I remember [reading](http://amzn.to/2FOp4Uq) how a young Leonardo Da Vinci was frustrated that he was born in a period where everything worth being discovered had already been discovered.
        
    -   It’s helpful for us to remember Da Vinci’s quote, because it’s just as true today. Almost ALL of the potential discovery that humanity will do is in the future.
        
-   Polymath Advantage 5: It future-proofs Your career.
    
-   “It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change.” -Charles Darwin
    
-   What do the following six professions have in common?
    
-   1.  App developer
        
    1.  Social media manager
        
    2.  Driverless car engineer
        
    3.  Cloud computing specialist
        
    4.  Big data scientist
        
    5.  YouTube content creator
        
-   Answer: None of them existed 15 years ago. Imagine the power you’d have if you could go back in time, master these skills, and then be one of the best in the world at them when they hit big? We actually don’t have to guess. You’d stand a good chance of being a millionaire. The headline below shows just how valuable a driverless car engineer is.
    
-   So what skills are going to be valuable in 20 years? Do you know?
    
-   No? Neither do I. Neither does anybody.
    
-   So the question arises, how do we make investments in knowledge now that will pay off far into the future?
    
-   I’d make the case that a polymath is much better positioned than a specialist. A polymath can take the skills that she or he has learned and combine them in new ways quickly to master new fields. On the other hand, a specialist whose fields becomes obsolete would likely take much more time to adapt to the change and have to start back at the beginning.
    
-   In an environment of accelerating change, we’re going to have to become polymaths to survive. We’re going to have a dozen careers. Each one is going to require new skills.
    
-   Polymath Advantage 6: It sets you up to solve more complex problems.
    
-   Many of the largest problems that face society and individuals benefit from solutions that integrate multiple disciplines.
    
-   Polymath Advantage 7: It helps you stand out and compete in the global economy.
    
-   One of the most fundamental mental models from economics is supply and demand ([see more valuable mental models](https://www.mentalmodelclub.com/mental-model-club-v2.html?utm_source=Medium&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=16&utm_content=CTA1)). It’s relevant to the job market, to goods and services, to the world of ideas, and to many other places.
    
-   You can have the most valuable skill set in the world, but if everyone also has that skill set, then you’re a commodity. By becoming a polymath and developing a unique skill set that few others have, then you’ll be able to differentiate yourself and charge more.
    
-   “What’s the one thing you believe is true that no one else agrees with you on?” This simple question very quickly tells you whether or not you have rare and valuable ideas. If you can’t come up with anything, it tells you that you might not be as an original thinker as thought you were.
    
-   “You want to be greedy when others are fearful. You want to be fearful when others are greedy. It’s that simple.” — Warren Buffett, founder of Berkshire Hathaway
    
-   “In order to get into the top of the performance distribution, you have to escape from the crowd.” — Howard Marks, founder of Oaktree Capital ($2+ billion net worth)
    
-   “You can’t make money agreeing with the consensus view.” — Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates (largest hedge fund in the world)
    
-   “The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.” — Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal and billionaire investor ($3.3 billion net worth)
    
-   “You have to be odd to be number 1.” -Dr. Seuss
    
-   The weakness of an art is its dogma. And when I’m competing against an individual from a different discipline, I try to find the dogma of that discipline. When I’m competing with someone within a discipline, I try to find their personal dogma. — Josh Waitzkin, Chess Grandmaster & World Tai Chi Champion
    
-   Bottom Line: Make Yourself Anti-Fragile
    
-   Being a polymath will be the new normal, and polymaths who synthesize diverse skills to create breakthrough innovations and solve complex problems will have a huge impact.
    
-   specialists risk getting trapped by their success.
    
-   Changes to the environment make them stronger. As new paradigms of business emerge or their passions grow, they can quickly combine their existing skill sets in a myriad of ways.
    
-   How To Become a Modern Polymath
    
    -   “The greatest scientists are artists as well.” — Einstein
        
    -   The idea of becoming a modern polymath can be overwhelming. Where do you start? What field do you learn first? How do you find the time? How do you translate what you learn into real world value?”
        
    -   During the hundreds of hours I’ve spent researching how to be a polymath and interviewing polymaths, one key that I’ve discovered is mental models.
        
    -   First, mental models transcend disciplines. They are the invisible links that connect disciplines together:
        
    -   mental models help you learn multiple skills much more quickly, because they gave your a stable base of useful and universal knowledge that you can use for the rest of your life
        
    -   In short, [mental models are key to becoming a better polymath](https://medium.com/the-mission/this-is-exactly-how-you-should-train-yourself-to-be-smarter-infographic-86d0d42ad41c).

Stop, Nobody Cares About Your Happiness | by Steve Spring | Ascent Publication

-   Stop, Nobody Cares About Your Happiness
    
-   ’s harsh, but it’s true.
    
-   Some of your close friends may even care up to a point.
    
-   But, most of them are too worried about their own happiness to care about yours.
    
-   Ultimately, you’re not top of anyone’s mind but your own.
    
-   It’s time to let go of what other people think. Caring about what they think will never make you happy.
    
-   You Can Give Up On Seeking The Approval Of Others
    
-   “An amazing thing happens when you stop seeking approval and validation: You find it. People are naturally drawn like magnets to those who know who they are and cannot be shaken!”- Mandy Hale
    
-   We all want to be liked, but way too many of us live our lives based on the approval of others.
    
-   We spend our lives trying to please others by living up to other their expectations.
    
-   You will never please everyone, and even if do it will not make you happy.
    
-   o, give yourself permission to stop trying to please others.
    
-   “If you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing [no one], sometimes not even yourself.” — Alok Pandey
    
-   focus on what makes you happy.
    
-   You Can Give Up Comparing Yourself To Others
    
-   “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” — Eleanor Roosevelt
    
-   You Can Give Up On Living Other People’s Dreams
    
-   You Can Give Up On The Negative People In Your Life
    
-   Quit caring about what other people think about you, and do what will make you happy.
    
-   You only have one life and you must live it on your own terms.
