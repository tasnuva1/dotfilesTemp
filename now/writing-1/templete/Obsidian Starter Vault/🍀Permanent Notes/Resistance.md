Resistance is the negative force that keeps us from doing our work. It stops us from ascending to higher natuer. 

Anything or any activity that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity will evoke resistance.

Any act that derives from our higher nature derives resistance. 

It is a natural force. You are not the only one who suffers resistance. It will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work. Not only it stops you from doing work, it kills your genius, your soul, and your purpose.


It is the biggest enemy of creative individuals and its recognition is immensely powerful.

Resistance is inside you but it's not you. That means you are not to blame for the voices of resistance you hear in your head. If you got your head, you’ve got a voice of resistance.

The real you must fight resistance. You are the knight and resistance is the dragon. The aim of resistance is to keep you away from all wealth, wisdom, and freedom that’s inside you. Its aim is to guard to its final breath.

Resistance arises second after passion. Its a response to the idea.
