# LONG LISTS OF GOALS 
`// Goals, Great How soon you need it. A task will immigetly move to the week calander with approsimate time (calander is the to-do-list, Isn't enough space that's the point, littarly not engouth time for doing.)`

### Projects for other people to use

Example: A go laybary. go-tinytime. Tinytime uses 4 bytes of memory vs the 24 bytes of a standard time.Time{}. tinytime only supports date from 1970 to 2106. (api expoger)

- anything that is hassal, it should be easyer,  you're compling about or this could be great. hassal-free.
- Any automation. could be a product or crate to make life easyer.
- It should be more simple. 

Remote phone:
you can use your phone with computer key and call, do anything.

Time tracker:
- CLI version and GUI version download option for every OS
- what gets mager, what's gets managed and what gets managed, gets imporved.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7mNKLccZkY
- add or importing goals, events form different services
- track idivaual file, tabs with in software.
- Spacified software and every time, repeate time, optional massage filed (used-time passed. It's clock-time) to notifide people. 
- drag, drag down the goals, for including the activities. 
- inside view, checkmark for toggling for more datils like demo, only for datils: https://timingapp.com/screens/videos/full_web_dark.mp4 
- spend time can turn into task in calander.

- markdown view to edit it. on top all the goals that you can cut and pase it on top of nested activities.
- add 2 fileds like youtube.com to mark as research group - goals.
- Maybe, automative catagoiztion into goal group mode.
- every setting should be a simple checkbox.
- all the dosbord making `~/screenshot/pictures/project-making/` for  inner logic replication.

Small Program called Universal Q:
- For repeating commands like shortcuts and mouse.

*A scripting language:
- A sintax of my own that creates bash script file to run.
- A compiler, interpreter. 

Record actions to reproduce the actions *******this is I can make for now*******
- recording videos. Keyboard clicks and mouse movement and clicks to bash script.
- could be vim/helex . like for globle. for start mod+. for end mod+. and for doing it mod+g 
- you can end it mod+. with a name or without the name
- internals: background a script will load with start recording, every key and mouse movement, a text will add to a tem file. or I will add that text that to in somthing which consumes all data in the mamory (io::sink) and when it finaly save with mod+. then we can rename it and then it's write that all at once 

An open source book reader.
- in every click or movement, It will scink to other device services by default. `and a button to manually click it. Other services like pocket for phone, For other platfrom devices, spacific app sinkcronization.`
- I can litterly import any articals and to auto tag as later reading (not read it), articals. `in chrome tor pdf broser urls as well, I don't need to download. it will download for me.` 
- obsidian scrolling and vim movements and hightlights feature.
- deffernt view for highlights. that view can be export into different formats file.
- a custom speed reading feature with sound or without.
- For leasoning option.

App loncher:
- input mode can be vim mode.
- center on little top is the input bar.
- For `/s` it has a prompt. or  for `/say` it will start reading mode with activation of basic 4 shortcuts, no refress, just audio and reading mode will on. `differnt prompt and different mode activation with a filed like /*`

*A File sharing website:
- For big files without installing or configuring anything. 
- instand trasfer in low network. To mobile or To pc.
- `First visit, type a username for yourself. then type sender username.`
- `A notification comes to accept request from username.`

OS:
- that has a android app support with the native window.
- that is stable, don't need regular updates.

Readwase highlighter:
- For supporting all the devices.

Tikcats maker: 
-  In blockchain for audanticate
- Form the eye of a normal consumer, oh blockchain ticats
- A permanint record of visiting this group/clube. all in one place.

[[rust-usage]]

`// what you want to build, at least, someone has made it a smaller version in that language. Build that.`

Quick assas:
[[#Projects and Theory]]

Essantal - time bound:
- Islam full script, the type of asnwer I am looking for is , mohamod said this  complitely opossite examples of what the hadit sayss what I want. üß°
- Youtube replie
	  - What id all regions are correct because all religions have roots in teaching goodness. What if God is one and every human can achieve god through their own ways which all religions are correct. We just give god different names but end of the day we are pointing to the same GOD. OR what if there is no god, no meaning of this life and we exist co-incidentally. Let's be good because one thing is for sure. Good is better than evil.


==ALL TO-DOS EXRACTION:== (all the things you want it to do has to be here. dumped all your to dos.)

==**Software Engineer: develops any kind of software. Web app Developer/Full stack, Mobile app Developer, IoT Developer.¬†fun¬†= pleasure = get something to work**==

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Inner Sturcture of the project:

- I join a startup founder to build a big product in rust in 2 years. Then sold the company. 
on interview:
- platfrom engineering. 
- software design
- architecture
- algorithims
- data structuresn
`// basical buiding a platfrom and how do you engineer it.`
in docs:
- problem and the solution and contrast with the alternatives. then fiting tools, CI/CD. (an open source product. developing it in long tearm in 1 year, 2 year) (all the interview question is in the docs)
- for open source product (paid product alternative), If I need see the jonorthon courese, so be it.

in resume:
- Do you know how to wride a car? yes, once I..example.

**those open source courses developer can, how much they can write code in 1 setting, which you can't ever write that in a month. inevitable trials. ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶°‡¶º‡¶ø ‡¶≤‡¶ú‡¶ø‡¶ï ‡¶§‡ßà‡¶∞‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶®**

- in other open source projects, only if there is a crusal bug.
- or a feature build.
- examples, test add.

ideas:
-  my goals, calander, planing question, marging.

** **```rs 
1. learn and create products for others to use and for others to contribute. (I will write as many code as open source developer writes in 1 setting or in one go.)
2. fork and shadow (can you able to do it the things they are doing in mantaner PR)
3. Am I able to understand the code?
```

Sharing things that you use. So others can use it and benifit from it as well. Being able to able to articulate problems. (**interesting an equnie thing that you create that picks intrest.**)

build a project to solve a problem, that will be the open source product. Build a OS. has the arch software community but don't want it to update. when install a app, it's not requaring a update.

==**Summary in one line:**==
- Building project logic and understanding code. For writting as many code as possiable like the open source developer writes in 1 setting or in one go, to get something to work. (mare matel,  mare minimum, mare essential)(become a better developer, not finishing a course.) (inevitable trials) `don't need to understand code first, First Building logic, translates to code. You will understand later, first use it.` 
- Theory extraction then Project extraction to embedded in your mind.

-----------------------------------------------------------

```
- in diffent fills, there is a smaller projects:
	- someting like: space invaders game, interactive data visulization, apis (for python)
	- **when try to picking interst, you have to see which one is more easy or effortless for you.**
	- next one will be, spacilization: Why you want to learn python, it's which projects your interst lays.
```

Evening 4am-7am
Night 7am-10am

- [] Theory extraction
- [] Start working on simple Rust programs to reinforce your learning.
- [] Review what you've learned.
- [] Continue Theory extraction. and work on more complex programs.
- [] Continue reviewing your Rust knowledge.
- [] Reflect on your GitHub contributions. (side-project)
- [] Prioritize completing the remaining goals and review your progress
- [] Celebrate your achievements, ensuring you balance rest and sleep.
