- **Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.** If a man is working towards a predetermined goal and knows where he is going, that man, is a success. If he’s not doing that, he’s a failure.
- opposite of courage in our society is not cowardness, it is conformity. And there you have the trouble today. It’s conformity. People acting like every one else without knowing why, without knowing where they’re going
- A success is the school teacher who is teaching school because that’s what she wanted to do
- People with goals succeed because they know where they’re going.
- People with goals succeed because they know where they’re going.
- if you only care enough for a result, you will almost certainly work out it. 
- যদি আপনি শুধুমাত্র একটি ফলাফলের জন্য যথেষ্ট যত্নশীল, আপনি প্রায় অবশ্যই এটি কাজ করবে.
- A person who tries to get the maximum return for the minimum of effort is only kidding himself. Sooner or later the scales will balance.
- Treat him with the respect, care, courtesy and good humor he deserves. Remember, he pays all of your bills every month. He will buy everything you will ever own. He may be coarse, crude, ignorant, selfish, conniving and a thorough going savage, he often will be. Here, it is more important than ever that you treat him, with all the care and attention you can muster. If you don’t, and if you permit his attitude to affect yours, you’re admitting that he’s the stronger person.
- The second-mountain life is a committed life. When I’m describing how second-mountain people live, what I’m really describing is how these people made maximal commitments to athers and how they live them out in fervent, all-in ways.
- Those of us who are writers, work out our stuff in public, even under the guise of pretending to write about someone else. In other words, we try to teach what it is that we really need to learn.
- Few people hiding stuff in me, because I did not give off a vibe that encouraged vulnerability. We are like beggars who try to show other beggars where we found bread.
- **Our commitments allow us to move to a higher level of freedom. there is another and higher kind of freedom.** This is the freedom as fullness of capacity. and it often involves restriction and restraint. You have to chain yourself to the piano and practice for year after year, if you want to have the freedom to really play.
- Frankl found himself thrown into a concentration camp. **He realized that the career questions**—What do I want from life? What can I do to make myself happy?—**are not the proper questions.** **The real question is, What is life asking of me?** **Frankl realized that a psychiatrist in a concentration camp has a responsibility to study suffering and reduce suffering.** **“It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us”** he realized. **“We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life —daily and hourly.** **Our answer must consist not in talk** and meditation, **but in right action and in right conduct.** Life ultimately means taking responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which life constantly sets for each individual.
- The important work, the work we really want to do, doesn’t come with a recipe. It follows a different pattern. This practice, a recipe is available to us—not as a quick substitute, a recipe that’s guaranteed to return results, but as a practice. It is a persistent, stepwise approach that we pursue for its own sake and not because we want anything guaranteed in return. But result will follow.
- we can always control our actions but we can’t always do much about how we feel, particularly when it’s about something important. **Your work is too important to be left to how you feel today.** The easiest way to go through life is to let life go through you. **We make a difference in the world when we seek to make a difference. Not because it’s easy, but because it matters.** This is all part of the practice.
- **only after we do the difficult work does it become our calling. Only after we trust the process does it become our passion.** “Do what you love” is for amateurs. “Love what you do” is the mantra for professionals.
- It’s a commitment to a process. We do this work for a reason. But our practice will fall apart if we are not commitment, hooked.
- **Doing the work simply involves acknowledging that we’re capable of caring enough to make the work better. To learn, to see, and to improve.**
- Of course there’s no manual, no proven best practices, no established rulebook. The very nature of innovation is to act as if you’re on to something, as if it’s going to work, as if you are chosen to be here. Along the way, you can discover what doesn’t work, on your way to finding out what does. It means that **you’re trusting the process and doing it with generosity.** and intent, and to accept every outcome, the good ones as well as the bad, a datapoint to improve. you’re an imposter acting in service of generosity, seeking to make things better by **accepting good ones and bad ones.** They're the data point to figure out how to succeed. Ex: how many not-very-good cartoons would you have to draw before you figured out how to make them funny? 
- the professional has to bring home the fish. That’s the fuel that permits the professional to show up each day. But the catch is the side effect of the practice itself. Get the practice right, and your commitment will open the door for the market to engage with your work.
- creation in service of better. The practice is not the means to the output, the practice is the output.
- When you're in practice: creation in service of better. The practice is not the means to the output, the practice is the output, because the practice is all we can control.
- Hope is trusting yourself to have a shot to make things better. But with **Generosity**. 
- ==The only surety you truly need is practice. The practice is proven, and you’ve embraced it. Now, all that’s needed is more. and More time, more cycles, more bravery, more process. More of you. Much more of you. More jonnra, more seeing, more generosity. More learning. It’s not working. (Yet.)==
- It’s impossible that all of your work will resanate. That’s okay. Great work isn’t popular work; it’s simply work that is worth doing. If there are only non-believers, the reason is simple: you’re not seeing genre the way others do.
- The work that only resanate with others, you’re not on the hook. There's no one to serve but you and the idea in your head.
- I’m clear about what matters to me.
- **If the only measure of your worth is in the outcome of a transaction, not in the practice to which you’ve committed, then of course it makes sense to cut corners and to hustle.** **Attachment to the outcome.** Attachment to what a certain person is going to say about my next piece of work. **The good news is that there’s nothing to hold onto. As soon as we stop looking for something to grab, our attention is freed up to go back to the practice, to go back to the work.**
- The strongest foundation we can find is the realization that there isn’t a foundation.
- The time we spend worrying is actually time we’re spending trying to control something that is out of our control. **Time invested in something that is within our control is called work. That’s where our most productive focus lies.**
- **we need an infinite amount of reassurance (নিশ্চয়তা), delivered daily, to build up our confidence. Instead of seeking reassurance and boasting it with worry, we could make the choice to go back to work instead.**
- For some of us, though, on the **hook is the best place to be**. It’s on you. It’s on me. Our choice, our turn, our responsibility. **This is our practice. The missing element, for so many, is our lack of trust.** We feel that we **somehow can’t trust ourselves enough to take this on, because it’s too difficult, too risky. Everything that matters is something we’ve chosen to do. Everything that matters. it should be easyer** Everything that matters is something we can learn. The practice is choice plus skill plus attitude. We can learn it and we can do it again. **We don’t ship the work because we’re creative. We’re creative because we ship the work. **
- **The practice simply asks you to do it more than once, to do it often enough that it becomes your practice.**
- you may choose to make the leap to be a professional, to have a practice.
- Go too far to please the audience and you become a hack. Lose your point of view, lose your reason for doing the work, become a hack. Focus only on the results, become a hack. On the other hand, if you ignore what you see and simply create for yourself, you’ve walked away from empathy. If there is no change, there is no art. The professional understands the fine line between **Professionals understand, showing up with a generous vision** and showing up trying to control the outcome. The best way through the paradox is by working. Ship creative work. On a schedule. Without attachment and without reassurance.
