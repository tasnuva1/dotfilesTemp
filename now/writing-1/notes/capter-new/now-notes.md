🎗️what ever stuff you're complne about. Just inspare people with the solution and you do some goood.

** computer networking:
----------------------

- computer connected togeter that is a network. Histroy
- Internet is a colection of this computer networks.
- How Internet started?
- Common Operating Machine Purposely Used for Technological and Educational Research 
- you are making application, someone else is making another application. They have different rule. 
- protocols = steps rules has to be same. different type of thing I'm sending to the Internet different types of rules will be requre. That's why you need to have set of rules and regulations.
- TCP - teransmition control protocol > IP = when more and more computers get add. -> insure data is not curracpted.
- UDP - User data protocol - vidoe call, it can drop a few frems.
- HTTP - Hyper text teransfer protocol - used by www. teransfer in web servers
- share documents that ref to some other documents. --> linking > WWW world wide web. basically store this documents.universally store and allows assas. I can find by url. It's a collection of all this Html pages. 
- Searching option was not ablbleable.
  we are connected throuth like actcual wire.
  I download it all the pages/files from google.com server/computer who is connected to even later called Internet.
  Client request, server respose. How the server teransfer the data? by all this protocols. Like steps and rules like package, small chanks.
- this computers and server are identifiated throught IP andress. It's like a phone book. when more and more cuputers get add. Actual value is link to a name.
  Internet service provider. modom or ruter has a goble IP andress. Modom or router will give Local IP address to connected device. How? by DHCP dinamic host control protocal. You're ISP send the request to google.com. google will see this 1 device goble IP made that request so it will give that date to that device. You ISP connected to Internet. I send the request to ISP, ISP send the request to USA, USA gives it back. That teransmition of data happendsby sumbarine cable. That's why it's super fast. Bigger intiti they get to the smaller entitieys. > ISP > control to me.
  How computers get connected:

physically: optical fible cables, coaxial cable - speed
wireless: bluetooth, wifi - for smaller range, 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE - for longer range
setalight wireless medium is slow.

LAN: Local area network: for small houses/office. in a area. it can be 2000 computers
There are so many ways to connect to the outside world. How to connect then? Enternet, wifi.
MAN: Matropolitin area network: cityes
WAN: wide area network: contries. > for that optical fibre cables.

Internet are the collection of all those networks. 

inside WAN: 
  sonet : sythcornas optical networks
  Frame velay: local area network to wider area.

  wifi/modem: digital converted to analog signls/elctrical signls. 

There variase ways computers are connected: (going inner)
Topologies:

1. Bus: connected to one backbone. since everything is been transmited by this cable, one person can send data at a time.
2. Ring: limitation: one of the cable bracks then that's it. d have to go throuth c, b then a to transfer  
3. Star: one centeral device that is connected to all the computers.
4. Tree: combination of bus & star Topologies. ex: ---|---|--- many many star are connected as a bus sort of way.
5. Mesh: every sigal computer is connected to every sigal computer. Expensive (so mush wire is been used), scalibily issus (to add, you have to connected that to every sigal computers)

Internet speed: 1 mbps = 1 maga bits you can transfer per seounds.

* ChatGPT Prompts: (building from utilitys)

-----------------

want: write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle by using struct.

1. what input data we need to calculate. and actcual calculation logic.

give me a program that I can implement by using Rust's features such as structs, methods, and associated functions.

discrpe that program and it's fuctionality in simplistic, non-code style manager. like this: 
"you can create a program that replicates a library system. where I can add different books which is my program data input. where anyone can see if a book is borrowed or
not. if avalibile to be borrowed, I can porfome a action of borrowing a book. if the book is not avalibile for borrowing, I can forfome a action to return the 
book." 

in really which order and what to do next:
when you need help to putting them all together:

1. I'm trying to write a Rust progrm to encrypt data. I know I have to read user input, validate it. encrypt it and return the encrypted data. please provide a complete sequence of steps for me, fill in any missing steps, and identify any unnecessary steps. 
2. when you provide an answer, please explain the reasoning and assumptions behind your answer. Explain your choices and address any potential limitations or edge cases.
3. whenever you can't answer a question, explain why you can't answer the question. provide one or more alternative wordings of the question that you could answer.  

when you don't know any steps to get there in what I want.:

1. I want you to *ask me* questions to deploy a rust binary to a web server located in AWS. when you have all the information, you need write a bash script to automate the deployment.
2. All you have to do now answer. ---> like interveiw. rather then you driving the conversation we let ChatGPT drive it.

The devil has something you can call insatiable hate, It's not enough for him to see adam burn in hell. It's not enough for him to see adam burn in hell. It's not enough for him to see haoa burn in hell. It's not 
enough for him to see his children burn in hell. He wants every single one of you burning. and every time he succeeds in, you could think someone's angry, and they kill someone, and the anger goes away. No, He goes to the next one, and the next one, and the next one. He keeps targeting more and more people. He says, "Give me time until they're all raised again." Why? "You think they're so much better than me? You think I'm arrogant? I'm going to show you how arrogant they are. Oh, you think I'm worthless. I'll show you how worthless they are. Oh, you thnk I have an anger problem? I'm going to show you their anger problem. Oh, you think I compare myself to Adam? I'll show you comparision.(boys/girls) These guys are going to make me look humble. Some of these will be so busy, I'll feel like I don't even have a job anymore. That's how busy I'll make them."

2. Reading, listening simple movable things
   Moon+ RSVP. video in big format into small moveable things.

What resourses is my taste? books or video.
Language doesn't matter. what matters is, what can I build with it?

- build a compiler and OS devlopment.    
  I can learn anything, I just need more time. 
  Master your tools. Git, editor, your enverment. For example, enums is your tool, a utility.
  Build good coding habits. Style.  
* Linux file system boot process order: 

----------------------------------------

~/.profile files are gonna run.
    (Unix startup: /etc/profile, then shell file which can be bash or zsh. ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login,
    ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc)
    If none of this process seems necessary, you may include all startup settings in ~/.bashrc.
inside x11 commend run for grafical enverment.
then x11 config file gonna run.
inside window manager commend run.

** Example: 

- First /etc/profile
- in shell/profile file: (link to ~/.zprofile) 
  components of X11 Window System: (display manager)
    Xorg (display hardware, handles input devices), 
    startx (start the X11 Window System server manually, with any configuration file),    
- ~/.config/x11/xinitrc
  if  ~/.config/x11/xprofile exist then run it. else run ~/.xprofile. 
  to prevent dogguling commend.
  - ~/.xprofile (Link to ~/.config/x11/xprofile)

* ALL THE IMPORTANT HIGHLIGHTS:

-------------------------------------

they (japanis) will save the money so that we (amaricans) can borrow their money and we invest all over the world.

we own commodities. japanis are savers there'r not investers. this (money) going down. silver save  

I own bitcoin it has integrity. it holds its shape because of blockchain 

integrity is body, your mind, your words, heart, your actions are one.

america is the biggest debtor nation in the world. what we do is we print money, and give everybody like this. take take take, it cases proverty.

capitalist vs comimnses/socalist we are at war. If you don't fight people will take everything. you still have kasmir. 

killing america is all this hippies pease makers. there're no more police and violence breaks out. so many people live in this farytes, oh if we could all live like we're in heaven. 

Taiwan vs Ukarine - Taiwan - what are they after thare? the semiconductors, raw meterials. TSC Taiwan semiconductor moved to US state Arizona. where did I move to Arizona case there's jobs. that's prosperity. Ecomomy boomed. So right now china wants Taiwan

AI's jobs will disappear. Yes, I don't need a job. Work for assets. So, I own lots of real estate, bitcoin, cattle, oil wells. we own leon oil wells in texas, louisiana, north dakota 

professors are poor people but they teach kids

idea monopoly is to trade up from greenhouses to rent hotels using debt.
trade up - sell something in order to buy something similar but more expensive.

split between the west and the east. india's in the middle.

Most school systems got marxist. They believe in taxation. Capitalists don't pay taxes

Binden, he was making oil so expensive he would wipe out the middle class. 

If they go to gold (china), american dollars gone. ***I don't think they will. the chinese are threatening to shift the Yuan to gold. begging it to gold.

BRICS Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. India you're in between. ***Just be careful who's money you use the dollar or Yuan. 

***I own gold mines and I own silver mines. So when dollar crashes I get richer. [your 401(k) would lose a significant amount of value, possibly even becoming worthless. Inflation would result if the dollar collapsed]

what do you think I borrow my money from? japan. I borrow their savings. The saving rate interest in japan is negative. They save more so that banks can give more in cheaper and cheaper interest. reason: to motivate people to put in the market. [that's where fake economy where created]

America today, what floats the stock market are pensions. same as here. [Wall Street is a street in New York where the Stock Exchange and important banks are.] and wall steet steals the pensions. ***pensions system floats the stock market. where's the money come from? important banks. all this people save money and they invest in the stock market, stock, boads, mutual fund ETFs. I'm an entroperneur, I buy the gold mine. I get the gold. I buy silver mine, I buy real estate. I buy the hotels. [stock market is fake, goverment pensions is fake, from banks to employee to pension/savings/gov-skeme to goverment or stock market]

America is going to be the poorest country in the world. starting now, you're going to see the biggest crashes happening, right now, that's good for me beacause the price of gold and silver go up.

Most people in india have been migrating to US. But now we see a shift, You're really smart young man. 

America never had sllums like that.

the builders are trying their best to clear out the slums. what they're telling them is, I built an apartment for you close by stay there for free while I make another building over here. in sllums they got that apartment for free and then they giveing it to somebody else for rent. and continuing to live in the slums.  

2009 monitoring, bitcone hit 20,00 crashed down to 1, I like eee, eee, I waited, then it hit 6, done so I borght 60. that crashed apented what made you so confident that bitcoin will go up again because I take investment course which are 2 called fundamental inesting and techinical trading. Most investor are techinical trading, they're watching market up and down, up and down, up and down.

I only buy , every thing, I never sold.
That's what we get (money). but then don't keep it like that. else it's fake. 

This is my warning to all the crypto guys, you guys are messing with the federal governments. goverment the moment they go to Central Bank digital currency, this bitquan may drop. because they're going to put this out of bussiness. **Gold and silver is god money, this is people's money.

I own oil wells,  I don't own oil stocks

Capitalist use debt.*****
This dollor is a function of debt. The only way this dollor money, comes into existence, is somebody has to borrow money. 

Money this does not exist. this is debt after 1971. it became the petrol dollar. I made a lot of money in oil. then Economy kept increasing and then they started pumping all the money into pensions - the baby boom generation. These pensions were stolen by wall street, is empty. ***Banks are empty. Our pensions are empty. they will show some stupte resion why that is. when pensions give everything blow up. I'm an entreprenur. Buy houses, hotels , rent

The whole economey is fake. the jobs are fake. but why they exist, for comminest. As a person who running the country is to ensure the maximum happiness of all the individuals so equel distribution of wealth. no everybody is equal, winer takes it all.

***Don't buy a house delay that prossas. Focus on building assets. Which pay you more money. I own 15,000 houses. given out for rent. Nothing wrong with buying a house. Difference is I use debt to buy it. and I pay no taxes.

1971 is money this cash became debt. Only way it's created is somebody has to borrow money. The moment you use cradth cart, money is created. I create money. I use debt. US dollar, the rupee, yen, taka is debt. they need people to borrow money. in the bank, I wanna borrow 20 milion dollars, I get huge tax breaks. Because I'm creating money.[you create money, more money is printed.]

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
        if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {
            File::create("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
                panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", error);
            })
        } else {
            panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", error);
        }
    });
}

Come back to this example after you’ve read Chapter 13, and look up the unwrap_or_else method in the standard library documentation. 

A function that returns errors to the calling code using the ? operator: 

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut username_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
    let mut username = String::new();
    username_file.read_to_string(&mut username)?;
    Ok(username)
}

It’s up to the calling code to decide what to do with those values. If the calling code gets an Err value, it could call panic! and crash the program, use a default username, or look up the username from somewhere other than a file.

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let username_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let mut username_file = match username_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    };
    
    let mut username = String::new();
    
    match username_file.read_to_string(&mut username) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(username),
        Err(e) => Err(e),
    }

}

If expected to always succeed:

use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")
        .expect("hello.txt should be included in this project");
}

most Rustaceans choose expect rather than unwrap and give more context about why the operation is expected to always succeed. That way, if your assumptions are ever proven wrong, you have more information to use in debugging.

In examples, prototypes, and tests, unwrap and expect can be used temporarily meant as a placeholder.

Sometimes you need to consider that it's not fair sometimes. It's all about politics to select a individual country for their own interest. And always saying, we are doing in the name of good which is everything (good & bad) Whichever greatest monument you come across has been built over human misery. Okay, Sometimes we judge things without knowing the details. Look in terms of workers I am not justifying that. Look, I'm a bangladeshi. okay let me tell you a story of the inter wired world, exapt some contrys like singapore. 
*TODO*
anonoging part is that it happands in this day as well. Depanding on who does it that's the one get's highlights in a  paricular image. 
When the Qatar world cup is happending.

Okay, Sometimes we judge things without knowing the details.
First of all if you are a gay, it is still not permissible to punish you unless you are promoting that. If you are private about it then that's bettewn you and allah. It is only punishable when you are promoting something to destroy civilization. I'll give you an example, in Saudi Arabia, if someone is absolutely prove to steal something with the  checks and balances. (State has the responsibility to full feel basic needs) Then the law is to cut their hands off. In outer perspective it sounds so cruel. But because of that law, when the prayer times comes, the shop owners they don't even locked the door, expensive jewellery or anything, they just cover that with a cloth and just go for the prayer. That's the level of safety we're talking about. Because of that thinking that no one can kill besides God. In USA, if they go to the jail, they made new friends and then come back with a bigger group and do that thing in a bigger scale. And if you comment adultery then the punishment is 100 hundred lashes. In outside it's look so barbaric. I am like where is the Mercy. People can make mistake it's contradicts the Quran. Then I find out, I am an idiot. Without looking into details I'm judging things. If you look, What are the requirements or checks and balances to establish that someone is committed the adultery. 4 male eye witnesses is needed. Imagine 4, not even 2. Unless you are doing in public, you cannot implement the law or the punishment. Unless he or she is not doing in the public,  promoting this. In older days, people were usually rough and tough, so when they committed adultery, they have that guilt. With that guilt, Sometimes they admit it themselves that they commit adultery. And they want to have that punishment. And again basic knowledge, preserve the family structure, and prevent unplanned pregnancy. As a result, single homes or single parenting.

Obviously you can eat or drink it in private. This is common sense. When you are openly drinking it they can proof that you have whisky or alcohol for sure. In public place, children and all kinds of people are allowed. That's why Only public place it is restricted. By drinking openly in public place, you are promoting alcohol which is a major crime in those countrys. You can watch this shot video to understand the perspective view: 

Speaking about abusing someone or a women, look what the Quran says oppression is worst than slaughter. If you're in a situation where you're being oppression, it's better to die, removing that appreciation from yourself then to leave in the subrogation. That's what the Quran says. This is how serious it is if you are abusing someone. I would have advice you to study Muhammad's life. And if you had a single doubt about hijab. then I would highly recommend to watch this video https://youtu.be/k8jjivj55rk It will really clarify your doubts because in this video this girl defended herself really well. ( The girl who doesn't want to hear the hijab )

Many companies actively contribute to the development of the Linux kernel, including major technology corporations such as:
Red Hat: A leading open-source solutions provider that contributes significantly to Linux development and maintains its own distribution called Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
Intel: A prominent semiconductor company that contributes code for Intel processors and other hardware-related optimizations.
IBM: A multinational technology company that has been involved in Linux development for decades and is known for its contributions to the Linux ecosystem.
Google: A major technology company that uses Linux extensively and contributes to its development, particularly for Android.
NVIDIA: A company specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs) that provides drivers and optimizations for Linux systems.
Canonical: The company behind Ubuntu, a popular Linux distribution that contributes to the Linux kernel and other open-source projects.
Samsung: A multinational conglomerate that contributes to various parts of the Linux kernel, including ARM architecture support.
ARM: A company that designs processors used in a wide range of devices, contributing to Linux kernel support for ARM-based systems.

These are just a few examples, and many other companies also contribute to the Linux kernel in different ways. The collaborative nature of the open-source model means that the Linux kernel is not owned by any single entity; it belongs to the entire open-source community.

-----------------------------------

why businesses use a particular OS in their servers?

Compatibility and Support: Businesses often choose an OS that is compatible with their existing software and infrastructure. If they rely on specific applications, databases, or technologies that are designed for a particular OS, selecting that OS ensures smooth integration and support from the software vendors.
Stability and Reliability: Stability and reliability are crucial for server environments. Businesses seek an OS with a proven track record of stability, robustness, and long-term support. They require an OS that can handle heavy workloads, run critical applications without frequent crashes or downtime, and offer predictable performance.
Security: Security is a paramount concern for businesses, especially when it comes to servers that store sensitive data or handle critical operations. They choose an OS with a strong security track record, regular security updates, and a well-established security ecosystem to protect against vulnerabilities, attacks, and data breaches.
Performance and Scalability: Businesses consider the performance and scalability characteristics of an OS to ensure it can handle their current and future demands. They assess factors such as multi-core processing, memory management, disk I/O performance, and efficient resource utilization to ensure optimal performance for their specific workloads.
Hardware and Vendor Support: The availability of hardware support and compatibility is essential for businesses. They choose an OS that supports the server hardware they use or plan to deploy. Additionally, they may consider the reputation and support provided by the OS vendor, including timely patches, updates, and technical assistance.
Cost and Licensing: Businesses evaluate the cost and licensing models associated with an OS. Some OS options are open source and offer cost savings through free or lower-cost licenses, while others may have proprietary licensing models with associated fees. They assess the value provided by the OS in relation to the costs and their budgetary constraints.
Skill Set and Expertise: Businesses consider the existing skill set and expertise of their IT staff when selecting an OS. If their team is already proficient in a specific OS, it can reduce training costs and enable efficient management and troubleshooting.
Industry Standards and Regulations: Certain industries have specific standards, regulations, or compliance requirements that dictate the choice of OS. Businesses operating in sectors such as healthcare, finance, or government need to comply with industry-specific regulations, which may influence their OS selection.

Every time you are in a fierce competition (red orgoin). besides making a better product, you also need to try and find a new market that giants will not bother to enter.

In total Google Spend 5,500 per student, out of which 5,000 are given to student and 500$ are given to mentoring Organization. It is the decision of organization to spend the money for the best usage, they may of course choose to give it to mentor of the student.
However, I personally believe, being a mentor in GSoC program is not about money, it is more about contributing to Open Source community. **More importantly, if you have enough knowledge to be mentor at GSoC program, you'll never have to worry about money. ;)**

Which open source project to give money?
 Sugar Labs is funded by MIT Media Lab?

MIT Media Lab why they fund different open source projects

---

**impact of proposed projects, the availability of experienced mentors.**

Open source organizations interested in participating in GSoC submit applications to be accepted as mentoring organizations. These applications include details about the organization, the proposed projects, and the mentors who will guide students.

How does Google benefit from Google Summer of Code?
It's a pretty cheap price to pay given that they get :

1) Good PR.
2) Loyalty. Finding good talent is difficult, and it's easy to imagine that participants in GSoC would be likely to apply to Google later on for full-time positions, not to mention that work done during GSoC is out in the public and can be more useful than an interview for demonstrating competence.
3) The self-satisfaction that they've done something charitable.

This not only helps to improve the quality of the open source software that Google relies on, but it also helps to foster a culture of collaboration and innovation within the open source community. (cheap libare)

benefit from or use Fedora in their products or services (Red hat sponser)

subscriptions include access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Red Hat OpenShift (container platform), Red Hat Virtualization, and other solutions

Red Hat's solutions are often used in various cloud environments, and the company may have partnerships or offerings that align with cloud providers.

The funding for LFX Mentorship typically comes from the Linux Foundation itself.

The Linux Foundation provides support and infrastructure for various open-source projects and communities. Some of this support may be funded directly by the projects themselves, while other aspects are covered by the Linux Foundation.

Infrastructure Support:
Hosting and Infrastructure: The Linux Foundation often hosts the infrastructure for open-source projects. This includes providing servers, storage, and network resources needed for code repositories, issue tracking systems, mailing lists, and other collaborative tools.
Continuous Integration (CI) Systems: The Linux Foundation may offer access to CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) systems, enabling projects to automate build and test processes.
Code Repositories: Projects hosted by The Linux Foundation can leverage the organization's code hosting platforms, making it easier for contributors to collaborate on software development.

Linux foundation - They have corporate sponsors, like Samsung and Intel, companies who have a stake in Linux because their business relies on it. As a result, they pay handsomely for Linux Foundation Membership and in return usually have more of a say in what gets implemented and when. They're the companies for whom the majority of full time contributors, including subsystem maintainers, work for.

<mark>IBM's Hybrid Cloud division excare GNOME</mark>
Red Hat is the largest contributor to the GNOME desktop environment.

the kernel of Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL, a Linux distribution developed by Red Hat, in order to provide extra support for real-time computing, together with middleware support for message brokerage and scheduling workload to local or remote virtual machines, grid computing, and cloud computing.

Red Hat produces the online publication Opensource.com. as a means for Red Hat to share technical content with subscribers on a regular basis. Red Hat Magazine became Opensource.com.

Red Hat is the largest contributor to the Ceph Storage SDS project : Block, File & Object Storage which runs on industry-standard x86 servers and Ethernet IP as well as ARM, InfiniBand, and other technologies.
Ceph aims primarily for completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level.

equiring no specific hardware support. Ceph's system offers disaster recovery and data redundancy through techniques such as replication, erasure coding, snapshots and storage cloning. As a result of its design, the system is both self-healing and self-managing, aiming to minimize administration time and other costs.

Red Hat operates OpenShift, a cloud computing platform as a service, supporting applications written in Node.js, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, JavaEE and more.[69]

The software purports to provide "traffic management, service identity and security, policy enforcement and telemetry" services in order to streamline Kubernetes use under the various Fedora-based operating systems.

all the distros, tools - Large companies and government tend to pay for support for everything. And yes, if you are a paying Red Hat customer and something is broken, it can result in actual bugfix work by RHEL devs to fix your issue upstream.

No big deal. I've worked at places that every minute of downtime was $100,000,000 (One hundred million) in lost revenue. First they don't have time to get on some random forum/IRC and get an answer, by some random person in the community. Instead they are getting answers within an SLA from experts. Red Hat has many contributors payroll. If there is a bug found, Red Hat will prioritize getting it fixed. This is far better than putting in a github issue and waiting for maybe someday someone looking at it. Then that patch/fix will be backported, because enterprises can't just up and move to the newest version.

 They don't want them spending hours troubleshooting some obscure performance bug, working to get common criteria certification, etc. They also don't want them spending their valuable time every couple of years upgrading their operating systems, trying to figure out what software works together, etc. Those companies realize the cost benefit of paying Red Hat, so they do

--------------------------

It seems as though there's a misunderstanding in what OSS is, what Red Hat actually does, and what is actually provided as part of a Red Hat subscription.
Red Hat doesn't just sell support for open source software. Customers aren't just paying for a 1-800 number. Some of the notable parts that a subscription provides:

Enterprise software that's been QA'd, tested, integrated, secured, documented, certified w/ a massive OEM/ISV ecosystem that removes risk for customers, and allows customers to focus on their business problems. Instead of building and maintaining a Linux distro, K8s distro, automation platform, middleware portfolio, etc. etc.
Product Security. Remember heartbleed, meltdown, etc.? There's a lot of open source players that worked to address those issues, but a big part of it was Red Hat. Lots of the OSS ecosystem actually waits for Red Hat to fix it first, for them to then reverse engineer their fix. A large amount of OSS is influenced by Red Hat contributions. If you use OSS from Red Hat, they have the ability to drive fixes and have them included in OSS you use.
Enterprise software lifecycle. Up to 13 years in some cases. What OSS community backports and maintains fixes in different code branches for 13 years? Open source projects will typically ask you to upgrade to the latest release if you have an issue.

This is some of what customers find value in when they buy Red Hat products.

Microsoft provides enterprise software using a proprietary (closed source) development model. Red Hat provides enterprise software using an open-source development model. The business product/result is similar, how each company gets there is quite different.

Another way you can summarize what Red Hat does is there's a massive difference in building a solution based on an OSS blog post that "should work" but provides no warranty, SLA, or commercial agreement, and building a solution based on industry reference architectures certified and proven to solve that business problem with included warranties, SLA, and commercial agreement(s) backing it. The former is open source community based, (which is great in its own right), the latter is a reliable foundation a business can build a business outcome around.

----------------

You have 800 servers that when a specific event happens, all kernel panic. It took 6 months of dump collection and analysis, attempted fixes, etc. to find and patch the bug.
And that’s a repeatable bug. Intermittent ones are far, far harder.
Red Hat support also works with hardware and software vendors to fix problems where they interact.
That’s why you pay for support. Patching and break fix are the most minor thing.

-----------------------

If you are a software vendor and don’t sell support, your software simply won’t even be considered for use. Your software might as well not exist in the eyes of decision-makers.

-------------------

The software support side is probably the main income though, as many enterprise organisations have a requirement to use supported software.

--------------------------

want a fix for the latest security issue? At this point in the RHEL6 life cycle, you have to pay to get access to those fixes.

--------------------

Red Hat is not a Linux company - it hasn't been for 15+ years. Red Hat provides solutions in the cloud, application development, storage, networking, security and provides services like consulting, training, certification plus a ton more.

-----------------------------

there are so many problems and so many software solutions, a open source software which is regulated has always been chosien.

---------------------------

Support-me-when-something-breaks is a very narrow definition of "support", and not the one that I think you'll find discussed among decision makers who select RHEL. Support isn't something that exists only during incidents, support is a relationship.

----------------------------

It's the opportunity to tell Red Hat what your needs and priorities are, and helping them make decisions about where to allocate their engineers time to address the real needs of their customers. It's setting the direction for the company that builds the system that sits underneath your technical operations. That kind of support is what makes RHEL a valuable offering.

-----------------

If you refresh your hardware and you're getting 15% less performance than you expect, and it's because a compiler quirk is resulting in too many cache misses, would you even notice that? An enterprise that just bought 500,000 machines might, and they might want to talk to the people who maintain that compiler, directly. A good number of those people are at Red Hat.

--------------------

Big companies like telco operator select redhat solutions/Opensifht, openstack, ceph to use these open source projects with support.

-----------------------------

If you want to do all this by your self. writting all the solution, all the inferstutue.

----------------------------------

Fix is also likely to get in sooner...as opposed to someone not paying, but a bug is only affecting them

----------------------------

Taking into account the amount of ecosystem adoption, the revenue isn't that impressive compared to a VMWare or an Oracle.
It's definitely harder to make money on open source software. Very possible, and "better" for everyone, but much harder.

-------------------

They charge $45k for a 4 node openstack deployment (orical) . And took there own sweet time to deliver. Professional services + licensing + support is big business.

---------------------------

Believe it or not, almost all software has bugs and undefined behavior. When you want to use a system for work you'll occasionally encounter them. Having that support contract is great for this. They will provide you with a tested solution, promptly.

--------------------------------

They went public and brought the opensource model of development to the business world. From selling cds with some linux distro to an OSS giant. Without redhat the linux ecosystem wouldn't have been of what we know today.

---------------------------------------------

I get it; what is RHEL for the casual linux user? Not much really, but for the enterprise world invaluable. 

Think about redhat projects, fedora for example is a linux distro where so many new technologies first tried and then adopted by so many other distros and I won't speak about all the other projects so useful for the IT professionals.

I am very happy that redhat starting from a linux distro mutters (say something in a low or barely audible voice) so much to the business world. I like that debian keeps alive the linux community but I am a little sad that Pat Volkerding is still producing (উৎপাদন) an excellent linux distro still after so many years and doesn't make enough.

-----------------------

They know most people aren't familiar with using and fixing GNU/Linux, so they help keep everything running smoothly.

The Open Source Applications Foundation (OSAF) was a non-profit organization that was established in 2001 . "I think that for people who use software, in the long run, open-source products are going to be less expensive and of higher quality. Also, open-source products put more control into the hands of people and organizations that use the software, which is a good thing."

open source applications foundation  - a Personal information management software. Design a new application to manage personal information including notes, mail, tasks, appointments and events, contacts, documents and other personal resources.

Many businesses and organizations use Apache software to build and operate their web services, process data, and develop applications. Apache's open-source model encourages collaboration and contributions from a global community, making it a valuable resource for both developers and organizations.

Cloud computing applications run "on top" of additional software that helps them operate smoothly and efficiently, so people will often say that software running "underneath" cloud computing applications acts as a "platform" for those applications. Cloud computing platforms can be open source or closed source. OpenStack is an example of an open source cloud computing platform (RedHat). closed source cloud like Amazon.
