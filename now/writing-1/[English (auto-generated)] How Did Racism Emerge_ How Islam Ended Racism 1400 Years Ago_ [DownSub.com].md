when you look at this picture, what do you see? 
this image was taken in coney Island, which was New York in 1906. this is a human zoo. at the center there's a native Filipino child surrounded by people who are doubtful about whether she's even human. but there's no doubt that they think they are superior. 

who taught you to hate the color of your skin to such extent that you bleach to get like the white man?

the year is 2024 we are making great developments but at the same time despite all these advancements we still couldn't solve the problem of racism. imagine a scenario where thousands of people don't even see you as a human being. even your death is considered insignificant because you don't look like them. 

how did racism emerge? what happened about this in history? what is happening today? and finally, you will look at how centuries ago Islam brought a magnificent solution to one of the greatest shames of humanity. if you're ready let's begin.

they consider them as Savages they see them as pathetic and worthless because of their different culture. they don't even want these lower people to live freely. what these people with racist mindset usually do is, first compare these people with themselves and then emphasize the superiority of their society. what a civilized Act. the human zoo is just one of the most tragic examples of how cruel Humanity can be it became very popular in many major cities such as Paris, Hamburg, London, Milano, New York City, and Chicago. 

but were the things that happened in America only against black people? unfortunately not. now let's go back to the period of torture of the Native American people. the Indian Massacre. to the period when America started to be colonized. tragically, the number of people who were killed is still not known even today. 

someone comes from across the ocean and makes you a stranger in your own Homeland and tries to ethnically cleanse your race. and they don't feel guilty doing this? because they see themselves as Superior. 

racism was spreading from continent to continent like a cancer. 


their skin color was different. their dress was strange. they didn't look like British people. of course, this was enough reason for exploitation. 

I claim that if those people had a Consciousness that existed 1400 years ago, these events would never have happened. but what was there 1400 years ago? // [pic] // more than 100,000 people are waiting for the words to come out from the mouth of this person, whom Allah sent to them as His messenger. this event is known in history as "The farewell sermon". Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him, looks at the enormous crowd in front of him and starts both addressing them and the people of all centuries, and says, "All mankind is from Adam and Eve. an Arab has no superiority over a non-arab nor a non-arab has any superiority over an Arab. also white has no superiority over a black nor a black has any superiority over a white except by piety and good action. 

in this speech there are many more messages for Humanity. let's stop here and think about it if the people behind all these crimes had the Consciousness and understanding of prophet Muhammad and those who listened to him that day. would these events have happened? I don't think so. In the 13th Ayah of Surah Al-Hujurat, Allah says,"oh Humanity! indeed, we created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may get to know one another. surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly all knowing, all-away." 

So why are we divided into different nations? to get to know, to meet one another. not to exclude or humiliate each other. not to be arrogant, not to exploit or colonize the other. we are put into different nations to meet each other. think about it. if all of humanity had the same skin color and the same language, would we be interested in meeting other people? we would say that they are all the same anyway, wouldn't we? but Allah created us differently so that we can be inspired by each other in a positive way. 
// [made us diffent, how the jugement will look like] //


// [need to add, eve child rules was diffrent]// 
but why should we have this closeness? because the Ayah, the sura says, "O humanity! Indeed, we created you for from a male and a female," Since we are all descendants, children of Adam and Eve it means that we are each other's brothers and sisters. we are each other's cousins. isn't the logic in the Ayah very beautiful? for example, imagine you have a cousin, but neither of you knows that. (is that great you are my cousin)

years later, when you finally meet after hearing about each other, you would want to be close, wouldn't you? in the pages of history that are full of racism, wherever Islam went, it has illuminated those places like a lamp and brought this principle of Brotherhood. in every land it reached, it rejected racism and fought against this mentality. 

This todays problem, the way how this sick mentality is formed is also explained in the Quran 1400 years ago. at a time when neither the field of psychology nor the word racism had emerged. The Quran explains this with the concept of original sin. when this term is used people usually think of Christianity, which is a belief that every child is born sinful. but don't confuse this with what Christianity says. because when we ask the question "what is the original sin?"" to Islam, the answer is very different. let's remember the story very briefly. when God created the first human being Adam, there were angels, and there

// [info about angles, diffenrt ceartion,] //
was also a Jinn called iblis also known as Satan. strangely enough, Satan says the following sentence to God about Adam that will sound very familiar to us. he said, "I am better than him. you created me from fire and created him from clay." sura sad 38 Ayah 76. it is very clearly a racist statement. he bases his superiority on the fire from which he was created and looks down on Adam who was created from dust. 
// [another example, humans take one part, ar o-n-no part che-e-ra da-e.] //
// [example, কোরআনে আলাদা আলাদা সৃষ্টি এক্সপ্লেইন করছে]

// [info it's form of respect. আদিম ইন্ডিয়ানরা শ্রদ্ধা করার জন্য যে এরকম করে পস্টেশন ও একটা শ্রদ্ধার পথিক দেখানো হতো. about potstration outcome, allah knows about it.] //
// [It's a memorey problem] //
// [as human beings there is no limit to the cruelty and injustices we can commit when we are left unattended in this world. and many times we tend to justify or normalize our crimes with rationals like demonization. you don't even realize what we are doing is wrong.

// [প্রত্যেকটা মানুষ যেহেতু আলাদা আলাদা সময় জন্মগ্রহণ করেছে আলাদা আলাদা পরিস্থিতিতে, এবং আলাদা আলাদা রং আলাদা ক্ষমতা. তাহলে কিভাবে আল্লাহ নির্ধারিত করে অরবিনেস, I am worth the of my suffering] //

// [Footnote: জিনকে ছোট বলে কিছু বলেনি কারণ পরের লাইনে ক্লিয়ার করা হইছে.  এভাবে পুরো লাইন মাথায় রেখে. কিভাবে পুরো জিনিসটা wholistakaly মাথায় রেখে, কোন কিছু asume করা.

this is how Satan rebelled against God. and this sin brought his end. if we focus on that story in the Quran, we see the following chain of events, as Adam is being created, Satan sees a different type of being. he thinks of him as a stranger and becomes and becomes cold towards him. then he begins to think that he's Superior than him. Finally, he reveals what he has been hiding in himself. 

in order to prove his superiority, he ignores Adam's other virtues and attacks him on the basis of his material qualities. 

all of these are actually the order in which racism is formed. so the Quran is actually describing the psychology of a crime that would be Humanity's shame and disgrace for centuries. and it is showing this as a quality of Satan who is the enemy of God, so that the Believers should see the ugliness of this sin and distance themselves from it. how amazing is that? isn't it really strange to see that even the first human being, our first ancestor was a victim of racism? 

so people need guidance in order to not to fall into this mistake. the guidance in the 13th Ayah of surah hujurat. in other words in Islam, your value is not determined by the things that are out of your control, (your color, your gender) things that you have no choice over. rather, you determine It Yourself by doing your best to be a Pious believer.

as human beings there is no limit to the cruelty and injustices we can commit when we are left unattended in this world. 


and many times we tend to justify or normalize our crimes with rationals like demonization. you don't even realize what we are doing is wrong. but at the same time, we are such human beings that we can choose the right thing among countless possibilities of wrong choices. 

don't you think that the one who created them and sent them into this world, will surely guide them? Even when we as humans produce a work, don't we want to be the most beautiful? So of course, the one who created us will also want us to reach the most beautiful level.

// [why other book has changed? every tribe has a massager] //
Allah has always wanted to guide us to the best in everything through the revelations he gave to the prophets.
