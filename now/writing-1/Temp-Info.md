I believe Rust has a great future, but getting a Rust job, even with 10+ years programming experience is still not easy.
Most of the jobs are not listed on sites. They are in hidden job market.

You have to be a good communicator and willing to do networking, talking to CTOs, founders and other people to find something. `meaning google summare of code a blockchain a contribute korta hoba, anyhow.`

**[If you can use it, you can make it, it's nothing special]**

you can watch some yt videos if you're completely new to the **blockchain structure**. It's just a linked list, nothing special. The hard part comes about building production-ready code. Firstly you need to choose between Proof of Work and Proof of Stack (it better be the second one) and then I would try to read and understand the code of some existing projects

**Here's my newbie realization of PoW: https://github.com/frolvanya/blockchain**

**And here's a full blockchain PoS ecosystem built on Rust called NEAR protocol: https://github.com/near/nearcore**

Proper scalability is still a current research topic, but **you can just look at popular **chain implementations** to get started.** **its for building block library ==https://github.com/darkrenaissance/darkfi== **

That said, most of the actual performance issues you run into have more to do with the **nature of distributed systems** than the language you use to implement them.

Write down the steps required to solve the problem on a piece of paper. Turn each step into a line or two of code.
If you cannot fit a step into 1-2 lines of code, make the steps smaller.

I think there are a lot of great books out there. I just think that this kind of abstract thing is best learned by doing.

what about a test project that just implements parts of it of a very simplified version? 

You could also try coding along with tutorials and see how they bring their ideas to fruition. 

structure charts are presented, which help with actually organizing your program and code into logical structures and steps. - Program Design With Pseudocode (Computer Program Language) 

The book explores a simple and powerful idea, that having your program logic match your data structures will result in correct programs.
This is one of the best books on writing programs that really work. - Principles of Program Design 

contemporary guide to program development fundamentals and implementation. The text explains the full program planning process and outlines the roles that need to be filled. - Program Development, Grantwriting, and Implementation

I was just wandering. if you can give at lest 2 month of free trial on CodeCrafters. I never used paid content since I am last year, high School graduate with limited access to dollar, living in Bangladesh.



With in this 2 months, I'll try to complete all the rust projects that it has. I was not aware of it when I started that it is a paid platform. And Your AI base suggestion in the failed attempts was amazing.

- data structuresn
`// basical buiding a platfrom and how do you engineer it.`

A open source product: what are the problems they want to solve, contrast to alternatives solution.

- in other open source projects, only if there is a crusal bug.
- or a feature build.
- examples, test add.

2. fork and shadow (can you able to do it the things they are doing in mantaner PR)

1. learn and create products for others to use and for others to contribute. (I will write as many code as open source developer writes in 1 setting or in one go.)

buliding my own open source product.
- Not just make it work, the enginnering side of it.
- Don't do too many things at onece. " I'm currently in the middle of something, let me get this done first. and then move on. " Bing done is the engine of more. Completing is a way to get other things done and move on.

although the core might be python kind of stack then build on top of it rust. for sicuraty fritical area and the sussis story is massif.
Encouraged you to try rewriting performance critical parts of your python code in rust.
It's really really difficalte to utilize rust like a lagasicy C++ stack. there's so many layers, it's difficute to unpack as smoothly as it alse wayer.

Todo: project making:
 - Design, develop, and maintain low-level blockchain infrastructure. ref: 27
 - different parts like protocols, virtual machines, networking, and data compression
 - solid understanding of blockchain development frameworks
 - liquidity mining, farming, lending/borrowing

option:
- blockchain that runs on the NEAR Protocol

1. Find that whether the tech stack is match of you'r learning or learned.
2. software you're using. (is this software used in the industryal level, economic, trade, startup useage)
3. or Software you like, problems they are tring to slove.
4. Active communities: present in slack channel or Discord server and communication gap bettween messages. yesterday or 2 days before or 1 week or 2 month.
5. or go to other channels or issues or PRs for how the maintainers are talking to the contributors. Helpfull, or not providing the resources, or not.

How this public/internal interface is integrating with another public/internal interface. how this interface is linked to that feature. project structure. Now you can relate to the problems/issues that are present. Now in developer mindset, thing that are not working, problems. problems are maintioned or not.

As a client, What are the problem they are solving and what is remaining to solve.

If I crush gravel hard enough I might extract sesame oil. Thirsty enough I could draw water out of a desert. Someday I will travel far & locate the legendary rabbit-hole But to appease the mind of a fool, that's beyond me.

At night a mouse chewed a hole in a wicker basket. It dropped into the jaws of a snake crammed inside, weak with hunger, restored by the creature's flesh the snake slipped free through the little hole. Stay within yourself. Fate acts; no one can see what makes a person rise or fall.

When health's intact, you're at home in your body and old age looks far off. While your senses are sharp. your desires potent, the life force hasn't withered, that's when the wise make their spirits great. Who digs a well, with their house already in flames?

Allah did not create you to not sin. Allah created you to know how to properly deal with sin.

every single one of the children of Adam is a sinner. - You are inevitably going to be struck by a thorn and there is aboslutely nothing you can do about it.


even the word repentance comes back to your relationship with Allah.

Allah loves those who turn back to Allah. Allah loves to forgive and Allah loves repentance. (Allah's smiles)

There is no such thing as failure in islam, unless you don't do anything about that failure.

sin is turned into a good deed on your scrolls. 

Allah removes the sin and gives you a good deed for repentance. (for dealing with that failure)

The degree that Allah guarantees us after committing the sin is greater then his sinless creatures, Angels. Because when a human being learns to deal with the sin. He was better after he deals with the sin.

---
Heard sisuations, obsicate make us strouge because we know how to deal with that. (learned) (now we knew how to deal with that sisuation)

and guaranteed you a better future if you learn how to deal with that past, in a way that propels you towards him. (drive, push)

Other peopel are looking at us or not, we are always focused on only the sight of Allah upon us.

Worshipping allah as if you can see him, sense of excellence. And if you can't see him then you know that he sees you.

observing the site/sight of allah upon you in a way that would deter you from doing anything that can compromise that love.
excellence is honoring the sight of allah upon you, in a way that would encourage you to do extra. (to earn the love at a greater degree, to even go further in earning that love of allah because you don't want to just be another average person.)

we go beyond the obligatory and we do that which is voluntary. We don't look at the people around us, or whether other people are looking at us or not. we are always focused on only the site/sight of Allah subhana tala upon us.

when that person is in ease, they give beyond their zakat, they give beyond that which is obligatory. They open their hands and their hearts and charity and they give, and they give and give. and when they're in hardship, they to continue to give even when no one expects it of them. They understand that Allah is the provider. and Allah is the one worth spending for. No person goes into poverty for giving for Allah subhana tala. 

(Islam establishes the right of a person to have what's been taken from them. Giving back to them to have their sense of justice. Justice is the societal standard. - charity, deserve, for giving what is there.)


But when it comes to the personal level, when 
a person is placed in a position where they have the ability to forgive and to show mercy and to pardon, once justice has been affored to them, They opted for a state of mercy. That's what they seek form Allah too. 

Then You see the love of Allah through all of your interactions. 

So, you aim for a higher degree of love, of Allah through all of your interactions. because of that you hold yourself to a higher standard, in all of your interactions. - in your worship, in your relationships or it's in your work ethic.

Becouse the degree of love that you seek from Allah is that much higher.

The soul that commands itself with evil.
A soul that is accountable.
The soul that is at peace with allah.  - their at peace with the faver of their lord. and they always see that pursuit of the favor of their lord. and they always see that pursuit of the favor of their lord. Even in the most unfavorable situations in life.

electron models is to ship an entire browswer inside every sigle app. Your app doesn't need to talk to internet, you're building local first.
3 - volunteers, a foundation, and a business partner. 

A partner for corporate solutions, case where you are building proprietary projects, you need help with confidentiality agreement. volunteers and foundation not gonna do that, so you have to have a company.

windows (what ever OS offers) and webview instantiate an enstance. in webview, based on OS, uses like webkit, that calls system calls for readering. 

we acually try to look at the shortcomings of the ecosystem and consider those from the foundation fo our architechture.

some web API's are complicated, like having asses to geolocation, web camera is tricky.
Features will be like having app tray.

When we are not sure what to do, or we don ºt have a strong sense of control over the task, action paralysis takes hold. 

negative self views. low self-esteem, perfectionest, self-criticism, negative thinking about ourselves, feel worse about ourselves.
Maybe the task brings your insecurities and self-doubts to the surface, or maybe thinking about doing this task reminds you of your own shortcomings. 
You could see this struggle as a natural part of learning something new or as the chance to get better at something and hone your skills, or you could view it as a signal that you are doing something wrong, that you lack the skills or competence to have everything go smoothly, or as proof that you are a failure.
The fact is that we rarely think about our self-esteem unless it ºs brought to our attention. It ºs something that operates in the background, often in ways that we don ºt always recognize or understand.
Self-esteem is your sense of self-worth. because they don ºt take things as personally as other people do.  Experiencing a failure or lapse doesn ºt detract from their sense of being a valuable person or taken as meaning that they are a failure. their worth that isn ºt easily shaken by minor setbacks.
This makes it easier for them to continue with their goals even when everything may not be going smoothly or as planned
Those with high self-esteem find the puzzle difficult but tend not to feel too bad about themselves

once for everytime, refresh async cercal, in the backgournd and broadcast updates to all clients/services.
it's okay to use synchronous locks in sasynchronous code. As long as you don't hold them for a long period of time.

app state lock it and did something with it - update. (How to bridge between sync rust and async rust)
then spon a thrate then do it in background. (then sync it / broadcast it to all clients or services by lock update refreshing is intensive)
why use new websockets endpoint for synchronized.
send into different thrate without blocking/locking, background to our async fn

this is all loopback. for updating the state variable. it actually running in VM.
You can run this over a network, instade of some GUI. it's in the linux VM, visualization.
now I could use ngrok to expose this port to the world,
