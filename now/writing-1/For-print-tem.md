if ego is the voice that that tells us we're better than others, we can say ego inhibits fluse success.
if ego is the voice that tells use we are then we are, then we can say ego inhibits true success by a direct and honest connection to the world around us. 
I am that good.

can't take or receive feedback or uninterested in hearing from others, outside sources.

if you start bellieving in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity.

ego tells us what we want to hear when we want to hear it. when I am lessoning to a video, audio.

replacing the rational and aware parts to self-abosorption.

what replaces ego is humility but rock-head humility and confidence.

ego is artifical, confidence is earned. some learn humility. some choose ego.

Humble in our aspirations
gracious in our success
resilient in our failures

noble maxims, "precepts for the years to come"

too often when we are just setting out, that is nothing. it's ego. the self belief which is not dependent on actual achievement, depend on valadation, ruled by our emotions.

public figures assuring us that we can do whatever we set our minds to. On the other hand, a man deeply tied and connected to reality. he was a man who come form nothing and accomplished great things. without ever feeling that he was in some way entitled to the hnorors he received. *He is reqularly and consistently deferred to others and more than happy to contribute to a winning team, even if it meant less credit for himself or less fame for himself. a quiet, unglamorous realist is forgatten or worse, vilified.

we think big, we must act and live small though focused act to accomplish what we seek. because we will be action and focused education and forgot validation. Highpothises put it to test by that we are deeply connected, aware and learning from all of it. Facts are better than dreams. 

Ego At the end of the day still wants to get as much credit and attention as it can for doing the least.

Success requires a full 100 percent of outr effort.

The only relationship between work and chatter / talk is that one kills the other.

who he sensed, had the potential to be something, to be something different.

to be or to do?

from doing to being, from earning to pretending.

--why would you acum it, ja this book a ta hoba.
--why would you acum it, ja this video a ta hoba. ata
--why would you acum it, ja this coding section a ta hoba.
--kono asaption nae. That's the way to go.

having the right and being right are not the same either.

having authority is not the same as being an authority.

impressing is utterly different from being truly impressive.

what the ego does it crosses out what matters and replaces it with what doesn't.

if your purpose is something larger than you to accomplish something to prove something to yourself. then suddenly everything becomes both easier and more difficult. it is easier in the sense that you know now what it is you need to do and what is important to you. 
The other "choices" wash away, as they aren't choices at all. They are distractions. it's about the doing, not the recognition.

Easier in the sense that you don't need to compromise. (not in the choices, not in the opportunity) Hearder in the sense that each opportunity, no matter how gratifying or rewarding, must be evaluated along strict guidelines.

to be or to do life is a constant roll call.

Always be a learner

we want to be ready, we want to be done. the need for a student mindset is doesn't stop the fighting or music.(this is my life, just be better at it) 

"When a student is ready, the teacher appears"        

Don't be passionate

Her virtues were still warm, she was above passion. She had a purpose. She had direction. She wasn't driven by passion but by reason. 

A young basketball player who won three national championsips, describe his famous coach: As not passionate. Dispassionate person. Wooden wasn't about rah rah speeches or inspiration. He saw those extra emotions as a burden. Instead, his philosopy was about being in control (not by shotan). Doing your job and never being "passion's slave"

none of them were driven by excitement or constant motion. It was a process of accumulation the reality. 

wroking very hard, we accomplish very little. What if the definition of insanity is this: Trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results. we are deliberately decrease our critical congnitive functions.

what humans require is purpose, reson and realism. purpose you could say passion with boundaries. realism is detachment and perspective.

passion is formed over function and the purpose is function, function, function.

learn to obey
Unwillingness to take a step back to potentially take several steps forward.

it's worth taking a look at the supposed indignites of serving someone else. It's not about kissing ass. It's about providing the support so that others can be good. The better wording for the advice is: find canvases for other people to paint on. Make other people look good and you will do well. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself. (so-bi-e ka ni-a upo-ra u-th-o)

it's certainly more glamorous to pursue your own glory, though hardly as effective. subsume your identity into theirs and move both forward simultaneously. It reduces your ego at a critical time in your career and letting you absorb everything you can without blocking others vision and progress. 

^Greatness comes from humble beginnings. it means you're the least important person in the room, unless you change that with results.

Say little, do much. Be lesser, do more.

You can forget credit. You can forget it so hard that you're glad when others get it instead of you. That was your aim, after all.

Find what nobody else wants to do and do it. 
Find inefficiencies waste and redundancies. 
Identify leaks and patches t free up resources for new areas.
Produce more than everyone  else and give your ideas away.

I have observed that those who have accomplished the greatest results are those who "keep under the body"

those who never grow are exicited and lose self-control. Those who grows are always calm, self-possessed, patient, and polite.

It's a sad fact of life that new talents are reqularly missed, and even when recognized, often unappreciated. Tose who have subdued their ego understand that it doesn't degrade you when others treat you poorly, it degrades them.

it is natural to get excited and swept up by their thoughts and feelings. 
A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.

personal brand. imaginary audience. their every move is being watched with rapt attention by the rest of the world so It feels good, so much better than those feelings of doubt and fear and normalness and so we stay stuck inside our heads instead of participating in the world around us. That's ego, baby.

^What successful people do is curb such flights of fantacy or fancy. They ignore the temptations that might make them feel important or skew their perspective.

To keep the diary during world war 2 despite the requests of historians and friends, He worried that it would turn his quiet, reflective time into a sort of performance and self-deception. it might difficult out of concern for his reputation.

Don't live in the haze of abstract. live with real, even if, especially if it's uncomfortable. Be part of what's going on around you. Feast on it, adjust on it. there's no one to perform. There is just work to be done. and lessons to be learned, in all that is around us.

The dangers of pride (early pride)

A proud man is always looking down on things and people and as long as you are looking down, you can not see something that is above you. It takes away form humility and connection with their fellow man & woman.

Pride takes a minor accomplishment and makes it feel like a major one. If you're doing the work and putting in the time, you won't need to cheat, you won't need to overcompensate.

privately thinking you're better than others is still pride. It's still dangerous. Work, Work, Work. Remember, someone somewhere is practicing when you are not practicing and when you meet him he will win.

lie to ourself, saying that yo put in the time, eventually, someone will show up. and You will be tested.

Delusions can pass for confidence, ignorance for courage. There's no way to beat them without it, we think. Flirt with arrogance and deceit and in the process, grossly overstate the importance of wining at all costs. "Man, that monstrous ego surely was worth it". Everyon is juicing, you should do it too.

What is truly ambitious is to face life and proceed with "quiet confidence" despite the distractions. To do, not be. It will be a lonely fight to be real. I am here lone fighting. "I'm not going to take the edge off, I am going to be myself, self with the reality. the best version of that self. I am here for the long game, no matter how brutal it might be". To do, not be.

Always stay a student

It takes a speacial kind of humility to grasp that you know less, even as you know and grasp more and more. Learn form everyone and everything. why would you acum it, ja this video a ta hoba. ata, why would you acum it, ja this coding section a ta hoba. kono asaption nae. That's the way to go. Ja ta shi-ka-r acha, o ta shi-ka fal bo. there is a opportunity to learn, even if the lesson is purely remedial, we must not let ego block us from hearing it again.

As people progress, they must also understand how they learn and then set up processes to facilitate this continual education.

^Don't tell yourself a story. If the players take care of the details, the score takes care of itself. The winning would happpen. Facts are better than stories and images.

There is no aha moment for his billion-dollar company. The founding of a company , making money in the market, or the formation of an idea is messy. Reducing it to a narrative retroactively creates a clarity that never was and never will be here.

asking companies and entrepreneurs, "If they're going to change the world." That's not how Google started. ^The way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things.

^Keep your identity small, fits well here. Make it about the work and the principles behind it, not about a glorious vision.

What ever we do, instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution and on executing with excellence. We must shut the false crown and continue working on what got us here.

If you don't know how much you need, the default is easilly becomes more. 

What we have accomplished often required feats of raw power and force of will. Work required the creation of something where nothing existed before. Wealth means beating the market and the odds. Athletic champions have proved their physical superiority over opponents. Achieving success involved ignoring the doubts and reservations of the people around us. It meant rejecting rejection. It required taking certain risks.

A smart man or woman must reqularly remaind themselves of the limits of their power and reach.
(in a achiment day, how can I forget this.)

It is not enough to have great qualities, we should also have the management of them. It will sink you if you can't grow up and organize.

Early in your career, you'll notice that you jump on every opportunity to do so. Marketing to reporters.

A mank is a man who is separated from all and who is in harmony with all.

in most cases, we think that peopel become successful through sheer energy and enthusiasm. We almost excuse ego because we think it's part and parcel of the personality required to make it big. ^Maybe a bit of that overpoweringness is what got you where you are.

the rest of us want to get to the top as fast as humanly possible. Now ego and the energy is the only way to stay there. No more obsessing about your image, treating people beneath you or above you with contempt, needing first-class trappings and star treatment. How if you want to live happy, live hidden. Most successful people are people you've never heard of. They want it that way. It helps them to do their job.

Material success: always busy, stressed, put upon, distracted, reported to, relied on, apart from - meaning comes from activity and that is the only way to matter.

"It's hard to be humble when you're as great as I am" Feel unprotected against the surroundings. Go remind yourself how pointless it is to rage and fight and try to 1-up those around you. Go and put yourself in touch with the infinite and end your conscious separation from the world. consciously conect with the reality, it is not a proferments.

"Men of great ambition have sought happiness and have found fame" What he means is that behind every goal is the drive to be happy and fulfilled but when egotism takes hold, we lose track of our goal and end up somewhere we never intended.

I'm not more, I am what I work.

Instead of taking what we have for granted, we'd be better to spend our time preparing for the shifts of fate adversity, difficulty, failure that inevitably occur in life.

Just because you did something once, doesn't mean you'll be able to do it successfully forever.

Failure

Reversals and regressions are as much a part of the cycle of life as anything else.

No one is permanently successful, and not everyone finds success on the first attempt. To rise again, requires a reorientation and increased self-awareness.

Turning slips into falls and ^little troubles into great unravelings. You could say that failure always arrives uninvited, but our ego far too many of us allow it to stick around.

She needed confidence and a willingness to endure. A sense of right and wrong, purpose. It wasn't about her, I was about preserving her family, doing her job.

^there are 2 types of time in our lives, dead time when people are passive and waiting. Alive time when people are learning, acting, utilizing every second.

Effort is enough

Let's say you've failed and let's even say, it was your fault. Shit happens. And sometimes shit happens in public. It's not fun. The question is: Are you going to make it worse? Or Are you going to emerge from this with your dignity and character intact? Or Are you going to live to fight another day? When a team looks like they're going to lose a game, the coach doesn't call them and lie to them. Instead, team remain who they are, what they're capable of and urges them to go back out there and embody that. Ego can't get better, it only sees the validation.


Are you deserve of that? if yes, prove it.

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. In the same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.

The only way to actually win is to get better each day.

If successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. It is only when they implement a system of continuous small improvements that they achieve a different outcome. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Work, Work, Work. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior.

Alcohol, coding what are the prove it's a reward. (reqegnize it's a reward, therefor wanting it, craving) Sinario, other people enjoying it. elon mask, fireship io. jon, normal people, similing and dreanking. (previce past experence to current reality transition has to happend) (join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. See others doing them every day, consider this a common thing to do. Fittingin with the tribe.) (once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.)

Why it's a reward, gives us energy, what you need for survive. It has a satisfactry feeling. Brings us more money and respect.
(why coding is a reward) 
Reward:
until now what you can do with it. (energy thury, same as coding, imutable linkedlist) (positive feelings, highlight their benefits, solve problem you need to solve) (like saving associate with freedom, rather than sacrifice you do. living below your current means increases your future means. The money you save this month increases your purchasing power next month) (like exercise develop your skills and build you up, instead of saying, I need to go) (mona a-na-u-e ka-ron amra vula ja-e, all the time. mo-na-e aa-na-la craving jon-ma-ee, because you want to do it, the outcome)

All of this is craving.

The cue triggers a craving, (the cue which detects the reward) which motivates a response , which satisfies the craving and ultimately becomes associated with the cue.

cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits.

Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible: like: the treats on the kitchen counter, the remote control next to the couch and the phone in our pocket. 
(no dout, I have to eat this, I have to see this, I have to see the notications.)
(the reward and what will happend is inavitable to you, you know this will happend, the benifit.) (you know the benifit will happend.)

We must begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Becoming aware of morning habits, like point and call exercise. Wake up, turn off alarm, go to the bathroom, take a shower, brush my teeth. 

you have to fourse it, intentionaly, awarenessly. Once an "implementation instention" has been set, you don't have to wait for inspiration to strike. When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. (like, Do I write a chapter today or not? Do I meditate this morning or at lunch?) Setting implementation instention: I will meditate for one minute at 7 am in my kitchen.

Purchases cycle. You often decide what to do next baseed on what you have just finished doing. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior. After I set down to dinner, I will say one thing I'm grateful for that happened today.

craving and able to do it, make it frount of us. 

It is easier to make a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues. Sleep comes quickly when it is the only thing you do in your bedroom. 

Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear.

the process feeds itself.

give the exposure to the cue that causes, habit, coding. reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.

If history (previous experence) serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will be more attractive than those of today.

taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media is associated with higher levels of dopamine, supernormal stimuli. Those thing are highly habit forming thing.

The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.

It is human nature to follow the law of least effort. It is crucial to make your habits so easy that you will do them even when you don't feel like it. Some days you feel llike giving in. on tough days, it's crucial to have as many things working in your favor as possible.

Wan to draw more? buildings, rooms, cloths. (AI can help, so that normal people can go from top to bottom, like coding) Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing tools on top of your desk, within easy reach. Want to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables on weekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to healthy, ready to eat options during the week. Want to exercise? set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, and water bottole ahead of time.

Coding, in frount of us. What to do, problems. leading to thought of possiable solution. (lay down the problems, not what to do.) (what to do tha-ka am-ar problems ku-j-ta ho-a-e)

Human behavior follows the law of least effort. The difference between a good day and a bad day is often a few productive and healthy choices made at decisive moments. Each one is like a fork in the road, and these choices stack up throughout the day and can ultimately lead to very different outcomes.

^Even when you know you should start small, it's easy to start too big. (When you dream about making a change. excitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to do too much too soon.) ^"When you start a new habit, it should take less than 2 minutes to do." In the problems list, first is the small problems. But don't highlight it as a benifit. (for doing the thing.)

Above are the things, currently least prioraty. Not doing it, to atlest 2 or 3 minutes. (and then forget about it) (case it's not importent) (after doing it for 20 days it will auto remember)
“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page”.
“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat” "do it 1 or 2 minutes".
“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes” "Data stuctures and algorithems".
“Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks” "from my wordrop".
“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes” "worm up with the shoes".
At some point, once you've established the habit and you're showing up each day.

Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
(coders relex by waching netfix at night, and 10pm sleep) (coders do that to make life easy) (practice is the best way to learn. learn what works, what doesn't, how can I make the practice easy, How can I make practice on my own.) (a coding youtube video watched in mpv and doing the things offline like enverment)

They form multiple skills. Drowing to real state thurey to how simple math works to my thurey works or not. 

laying out all coding thureyes like a sintence. and exicutes. Felling the arge to find out.

"It almost alsways happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, (movie, chilling) the later consequences are disastrous and vice versa"

"the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits" (speading, reverse is saving)

another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present. (by tolarating paranat behavier, at the sametime, working each day, to make the next, next year to better, tolarting my cost of current good habits by ignoring the sweetnest of the series, storyes, proferments, entertenment) The costs of your bad habits are in the future.

For the end I have to get it through. (why not just doing it simple rasing incompitent child, I have a responsibility to make for optaing plasure. deserving or testing the more frashing way the plasure. )

[do not see: I try it, so hard and gots so far at the end it dosn't even matter. Yes, it dosn't even matter, that's the pease. (and that's where you wanna get at.) wayther is future things, or alhamdulila paradis feeling when I'm in, hopfully.]

![[In_the_End_-_Best_Ringtone(256k).mp3]]
(that's the point.)

ami su-du ma-t-ro OE ko-s-to ta ka nea regreat ko-re ja tar jo-n-no ami wardy na.
^"There is only on thing I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings." These suffering, death, are bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom can not be lost. It can be said that they were worthy of their sufferings, the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedom, which can not be taken away that, makes life meaningful and purposeful.
(I am not losing anything.)

problem: I don't even want to remember the point, when I thought about the pictures and rewaird right in frount of my eyes. SO takaled with an other pictures.??? Once for Once you remember it, YOU can not do other things. YOUR mind will not let you. (everything is asosiate with the imigate felling)
What kind of image that will trigger all of these???

This is precisely what research has shown. People who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills.

To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful, even if it's in a small way. A visual measure. Shifted a hairpin from one container to another whenever she wrote a page of her book. Moved a marble from one bin to the next after, each set of push ups. Calendar to cross off each day you stick with your routine.

Don't break the chain of creating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio. A calender for each habit tracking. Or sticky note for top x is date number, left y is habit name, cell cross out. and for problem list left 2 colum. and for book page reading, like excel every cell will used for cross out execpt first top left cell to write book name. (a card like thing to stack all the sticky notes, when ever is need it rearrage to level up) A daily food log. When the evidence is right in front of you, you're less likely to lie to yourself. After I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move one paper clip over. After I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will write down what I ate.

Never miss twice. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

^When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

^If a failure is painful, it gets fixed, if a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. (in coding it's true)

Bad habits, there can't be a gap between the action and the consequences. 

Body builder or rock climbing or rowing, shape your exercise around your interests. A low carb diet or low fat diet. romance novels or non-fiction, read whatever fascinates you. Tailoring your habit to your personality is a good start. Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a stuggle.

^Which is best suits you, initial period of exploration, shift your focus to best solution you've found. (in coding different fileds) The proper balance depends on whether you're winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you ^^exploit, exploit, exploit, if you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore. ^The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do. Work hard on the things that come easy, meaning continuse work.

My todo or problem list progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You have a good chance of winning, but only if you really try. Your focus narrows, distractions fade away, and you find yourself fully invested in the task at hand. Humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. like in new material, a few jokes that were guaranteed to get laughs. There were just enough victories to keep him motivated and just enough mistakes to keep him working hard.

At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over. ^The greates threat to success is not failure but boredom. (completing this importent task, you gotta do something that other people don't want to do) Professionals take action even when the mood isn't right. A surgeons need to repeate his first incision so many times, that they can do it with their eyes closed so that they can focus on the hundreds of variables that arise during surgery.

Annual review. I count up how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, how many articles I published, and more in that year. Reflect on my progress, what I lack of. By answering, 1. What went well this year? 2. What didn't go so well this year? 3. What did I learn?

In life, you roatate the 4 things until you find the next bottleneck. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying. Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross off. Endless process to refine the problems in your doing things. So, looking for improvement try those 4 things.

Part of the process quotes:

You are one decision away from a completely different life.

Five seconds of courage makes all the difference.

Courage of get out of bed. 

Courage is found in your unlikely places.

It's not the big moves that define our lives, it's the smallest ones. Just do it.

Change requires you to do things that are uncertain, scary, new. repeat the 4 rule and destroy the old doing things.

Change your decisions and you'll change your life.

If you have the courage to start, you have the courage to succeed. Courage is a birth right. It is inside every one of us.

A different part of our brains is activated when we thing about what's possible rather than what's required.

The time is always right to do, what is right. What are you waiting for? There is no right time. There is only right now.

Nobody wil help you until you help yourself by taking action first. You can't control how you feel. But you can always choose how you act. Either you run the day or the day runs you.

To reach your potential, you'll have to push yourself. There is no other way.

Delete your social media apps, remove useless stuff that is distracting you.

James who wrote the blockbuster Fifty Shades of Gray trilogy (that was devoured by nearly every woman on the planet Earth and sold a million copies in four days) is the fact that she didn’t wait for permission, the right time, or to feel ready. She didn’t wait until she had a book deal.

Everyone will tell yo that if they had told themselves to wait until they felt ready or until they had a sponsor, they would still be living a boring life instead creating a life of their dreams. You have got to work for what you want. (don't fool by shatan)

Do you know the game Angry Birds? Rovio, the brand that created the game, launched 51 unsuccessful games before they developed Angry Birds. How about The Avengers star Mark Ruffalo? Do you know how many auditions he did before he landed his first role? Almost 600! Picasso created nearly 100 masterpieces in his lifetime. But what most people don’t know is that he created a total of more than 50,000 works of art.

Part of the process quotes:

Don't tell people your dreams. Show them. Curage to pursue them, you'll either find a way or you'll find an excuse. To begin is to begin. You were taught how to warry. Nothing comes naturally. You have to practice it every day. Speak form your heart, even if your voice shakes.

^Nothing in life is perfect. Nothing at all. But you can use 5- 4- 3- 2- 1 to quiet the mental chatter.

^If your mind can't find a suitable explanation, your brain will make the anxiety worse, so that you will want to physically run away from the situation and leave the room.

Procrastination makes you feel like you have no control over yourself. First forgive youself for not controling yourself. Repleace with getting started. The moment you feel yourself hesitate, doing easier tasks or avoiding hard work - use rule 5- 4- 3- 2- 1 push yourself to start the important thing you need to do. You are taking control of the moment and your life.

^In the day, putting the phone into the bathroom/table so that you have to go there in order to turn it off and as a result, you will wake up. ^During the day, focus on the day ahead aout the things that I must do today. Get dressed, make my bed, walk into the kitchen, and pour a cup of tea. ^Jots 5 problems that I feel must do today. I take 30 minutes before 7:30 am to plan out my day. And I plan my quitting time, the time I will stop working, give your workday a deadline.

I start to count 5- 4- 3- 2- 1 to flush the fear out of my head (a sound) and pull myself into the present moment and push yourself to move forword.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ultimately, it’s a new story for thinking about finding a path in life. As the world continues to change and technology reshapes our lives, the stories we use to navigate life become outdated and come up short. People are starting to feel the disconnect between what we’ve been told about how the world works and what they experience. You work hard but get laid off anyway.

Instead of thinking about what you want to do with your life, you default to the options most admired by your peers.

One is the “way of loss,” when things that matter are taken from us, such as loved ones, our health, or a job. The other path is the “way of wonderment,” when we are faced with moments of undeniable awe and inspiration.  These moments make us feel connected to something bigger than ourselves and make us think about the mysteries of life.

each of us has a personal calling. To her, the “best way to succeed is to discover what you love and then find a way to offer it to others in the form of service, working hard, and also allowing the energy of the universe to lead you.”

People who defined their work as a calling saw their work as “inseparable from their life” and worked, “not for financial gain or career advancement, but instead for the fulfillment that doing the work brings to the individual.” The researchers boldly concluded that if people could find work they saw as a calling it would improve their “life, health, and job satisfaction.”

Later: By experimenting with different ways of showing up in the world and making small, deliberate changes, we can open ourselves up to the unexpected opportunities, possibilities, and connections that might tell us what comes next.

Callard defines aspiration as the slow process of “trying on the values that we hope one day to possess.” where we already know what we value. For example, someone who wants to make a lot of money already values money. They don’t need to learn why they want it along the way. Callard argues that the aspirant’s understanding of the value of their pursuits “is characterized by a distinctive kind of vagueness, one she experiences as defective and in need of remedy.”

Although people considering the option of leaving the default path can list hundreds of things that might go wrong, they struggle to talk about the fears behind those risks. In hundreds of conversations with people, found these fears fall into one of the following five areas: 1. Success: “What if I’m not good enough?” 2. Money: “What happens if I go broke?” 3. Health: “What if I get sick?” 4. Belonging: “Will I still be loved?” 5. Happiness: “What if I am not happy?” I was afraid of going broke after I quit my job, I realized that there were fifty different things I could do to make money. But I couldn't. ^List some steps or actions you might take to get back to where you are today. ^What could be some benefits of an attempt or partial success? ^What is the cost of inaction in three months, 12 months, and in a few years?

Default path can be a good starting point, but if you lean into your unique psychology, interests, and sense of humor, your journey will be a little more fun and much more meaningful.

^Not these worries disappear. It’s to develop a capacity to sit with those anxieties, focus on what I can control, and open myself up to the world.

The best they can be at what they care about most.

Bussiness woman, I’m here to tell you to take your doubts seriously and demand better!

The belief that full‑time work is normal, however, doesn’t match with reality.

How much money is important? On the pathless Business path, knowing you have enough is what gives you the freedom to say “no” to clear financial opportunities and say “yes” to something that might bring you alive and closer to god. And janna pay off much more over the long term.

^^Why it's matters? What matters? Why do we work? What is the good life? (work that brings us more alive)

^we need a coherent internal narrative about why we live a certain way. This is the ethos of the pathless path and if you don’t know or understand your own story, you will struggle.

If you start with, ^what brought you alive? (in the past) (However, difficulty remains, figuring out how to get started.)

 I became more optimistic not because I started to write better or was right, but because I stopped hiding. I led with my curiosity, vulnerability, and passion and it immediately attracted the kind of people I wanted to meet.

how I want to live, I start instead with what I don’t want to be doing and what failure looks like.

principle of inversion, popularized by German mathematician Carl Jacobi. He told his students to “invert, always invert,” encouraging them to approach difficult problems by inverting the equation to gain a new perspective.

During my time on the default path, I often imagined a future version of myself that I knew I didn’t want to be: an overweight guy in his 50s who barely tolerates the people in his life.

This is why I’ve spent so much time focusing on creating the conditions for success and lowering my risk of failure, rather than aiming at success itself.

The full realization of the individual’s potential, together with his ability to live actively and spontaneously

how many people deal with change: by denying, delaying, or rejecting it. (changes of doing the work)

Only give gifts to kids and paranse. Only those people don't feel like I owe you one. It could be a feeling of obligation. or giving property to close family members.

Once you open yourself up to possibilityes and start experimenting with different ways of working and living, doing bussness, The biggest problem is the paradox of choice. There are too many insteresting things worth doing and too many places to visit.--------------

when an obvious path emerges, there is often a more interesting path not showing itself.

^Most of us run on autopilot through life but we can break out of this mode by considering even the simplest reflection exercises. (not doing anything)

easiest ways to begin this exploration is to send a message to a few close friends, asking them, “When have you seen me at my best self?” others have a better perspective on what makes us stand out.

pause and disconnect. To improve your relationship with work, blocking off a random Tuesday afternoon, or another day in the workweek. Don’t tell anyone what you are doing and go wander. Go for a long walk, a bike ride, or sit by a river.

 Over time, designing your work in a way that will help you naturally “find the others,” can be one of the most rewarding things of being on the pathless path and one of the most valuable things you can do in life.

 It’s just that the legacy of the default path has convinced people that they need permission. But you know this is not true anymore. Find a way to create. Host a dinner party, organize a volunteer event, write a blog post, start journaling in the morning, paint a picture, or host a cooking class for your friends. the sooner you figure out a way to create and share with the world, the faster you’ll be able to move closer to finding the activities you want to continue doing throughout your life.

test your money beliefs, embrace unique fixed-point goals, and create things you never thought were possible. Remember, the goal is not to get rich but always to figure out what to do next.

real work of your life is searching the opportunity to feel useful and to do things that challenged me to grow and committing to that thing that makes your life more meaningful. Don’t rush things. Remember: nothing good gets away, as long as you create the space to let it emerge.

It absolutely sickens me to encounter users who seem to be incapable of using git without a proprietary communications tool.

Just explor what are the big software avalibale and what are the deficiency it has or lack it has in other hosting code versions site or communication tool to upadate/send patches.

A populor libary or software, How it works and what it's lacks, what are the deficiencey it has.

GitHub made open source much more about people than projects and about the production of software. Coding became like tweeting in more ways than one.

Code collaboration wasn’t supposed to belong to anyone. Use AI.

“amateurization of open source,” where “pushing code became almost as routine as tweeting".

with the result that nearly-trivial functionality can be packaged and reused.
